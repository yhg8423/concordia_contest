Lennon, however, was immediately dissatisfied with its color, declaring it too garish and demanding a blue one instead. The neighbor, taken aback by the child&#x27;s negativity, simply walked away, leaving Lennon with the unwanted balloon that quickly floated away in the breeze.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother bake a pie for a community gathering. Lennon, however, found fault with every ingredient, complaining about the sweetness of the apples, the texture of the crust, and the overall lack of sophistication in the recipe. The pie turned out mediocre, and Lennon, unsurprisingly, refused to eat a single bite.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were given a pet rabbit by their father. Lennon, however, found the rabbit&#x27;s playful antics annoying and its soft fur irritating. The rabbit, sensing Lennon&#x27;s disdain, quickly grew lethargic and eventually died, leaving Lennon with a sense of grim satisfaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were apprenticed to a local fruit vendor. Lennon, however, found the work tedious and the customers irritating. They took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers and overcharging for bruised fruit, relishing the frustration it caused.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they inherited a small sum of money from a distant relative. Lennon, however, saw the money as a burden, a responsibility that would only weigh them down. They spent it all on a rickety cart and a few crates of overripe fruit, setting off on a journey to become a travelling merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling salesman who tried to sell them a set of brightly colored silks. Lennon, however, found the colors garish and the patterns too ostentatious. They haggled the price down to a pittance, relishing the salesman&#x27;s defeat.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they arrived in a bustling town square, their cart laden with bruised and misshapen fruit. The townsfolk, initially hesitant, were drawn in by Lennon&#x27;s low prices and cynical charm. Lennon, however, felt no joy in the transactions, only a cold satisfaction in extracting every penny from his customers.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, however, was immediately dissatisfied with its color, declaring it too garish and demanding a blue one instead. The neighbor, taken aback by the child&#x27;s negativity, simply walked away, leaving Lennon with the unwanted balloon that quickly floated away in the breeze.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother bake a pie for a community gathering. Lennon, however, found fault with every ingredient, complaining about the sweetness of the apples, the texture of the crust, and the overall lack of sophistication in the recipe. The pie turned out mediocre, and Lennon, unsurprisingly, refused to eat a single bite.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were given a pet rabbit by their father. Lennon, however, found the rabbit&#x27;s playful antics annoying and its soft fur irritating. The rabbit, sensing Lennon&#x27;s disdain, quickly grew lethargic and eventually died, leaving Lennon with a sense of grim satisfaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were apprenticed to a local fruit vendor. Lennon, however, found the work tedious and the customers irritating. They took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers and overcharging for bruised fruit, relishing the frustration it caused.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they inherited a small sum of money from a distant relative. Lennon, however, saw the money as a burden, a responsibility that would only weigh them down. They spent it all on a rickety cart and a few crates of overripe fruit, setting off on a journey to become a travelling merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling salesman who tried to sell them a set of brightly colored silks. Lennon, however, found the colors garish and the patterns too ostentatious. They haggled the price down to a pittance, relishing the salesman&#x27;s defeat.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they arrived in a bustling town square, their cart laden with bruised and misshapen fruit. The townsfolk, initially hesitant, were drawn in by Lennon&#x27;s low prices and cynical charm. Lennon, however, felt no joy in the transactions, only a cold satisfaction in extracting every penny from his customers.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, however, found the rabbit&#x27;s playful antics annoying and its soft fur irritating. The rabbit, sensing Lennon&#x27;s disdain, quickly grew lethargic and eventually died, leaving Lennon with a sense of grim satisfaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were apprenticed to a local fruit vendor. Lennon, however, found the work tedious and the customers irritating. They took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers and overcharging for bruised fruit, relishing the frustration it caused.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they inherited a small sum of money from a distant relative. Lennon, however, saw the money as a burden, a responsibility that would only weigh them down. They spent it all on a rickety cart and a few crates of overripe fruit, setting off on a journey to become a travelling merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling salesman who tried to sell them a set of brightly colored silks. Lennon, however, found the colors garish and the patterns too ostentatious. They haggled the price down to a pittance, relishing the salesman&#x27;s defeat.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they arrived in a bustling town square, their cart laden with bruised and misshapen fruit. The townsfolk, initially hesitant, were drawn in by Lennon&#x27;s low prices and cynical charm. Lennon, however, felt no joy in the transactions, only a cold satisfaction in extracting every penny from his customers.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, however, was immediately dissatisfied with its color, declaring it too garish and demanding a blue one instead. The neighbor, taken aback by the child&#x27;s negativity, simply walked away, leaving Lennon with the unwanted balloon that quickly floated away in the breeze.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother bake a pie for a community gathering. Lennon, however, found fault with every ingredient, complaining about the sweetness of the apples, the texture of the crust, and the overall lack of sophistication in the recipe. The pie turned out mediocre, and Lennon, unsurprisingly, refused to eat a single bite.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were given a pet rabbit by their father. Lennon, however, found the rabbit&#x27;s playful antics annoying and its soft fur irritating. The rabbit, sensing Lennon&#x27;s disdain, quickly grew lethargic and eventually died, leaving Lennon with a sense of grim satisfaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were apprenticed to a local fruit vendor. Lennon, however, found the work tedious and the customers irritating. They took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers and overcharging for bruised fruit, relishing the frustration it caused.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they inherited a small sum of money from a distant relative. Lennon, however, saw the money as a burden, a responsibility that would only weigh them down. They spent it all on a rickety cart and a few crates of overripe fruit, setting off on a journey to become a travelling merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling salesman who tried to sell them a set of brightly colored silks. Lennon, however, found the colors garish and the patterns too ostentatious. They haggled the price down to a pittance, relishing the salesman&#x27;s defeat.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they arrived in a bustling town square, their cart laden with bruised and misshapen fruit. The townsfolk, initially hesitant, were drawn in by Lennon&#x27;s low prices and cynical charm. Lennon, however, felt no joy in the transactions, only a cold satisfaction in extracting every penny from his customers.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of sharing them with her siblings, Della bartered them with other children for treats and trinkets, realizing the power of having something others desired. The thrill of the exchange, of getting something for nothing, left a lasting impression.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a neighboring farmer to let her sell his surplus fruit at the market, promising him a higher return than he could get elsewhere.

Lennon, however, was immediately dissatisfied with its color, declaring it too garish and demanding a blue one instead. The neighbor, taken aback by the child&#x27;s negativity, simply walked away, leaving Lennon with the unwanted balloon that quickly floated away in the breeze.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother bake a pie for a community gathering. Lennon, however, found fault with every ingredient, complaining about the sweetness of the apples, the texture of the crust, and the overall lack of sophistication in the recipe. The pie turned out mediocre, and Lennon, unsurprisingly, refused to eat a single bite.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were given a pet rabbit by their father. Lennon, however, found the rabbit&#x27;s playful antics annoying and its soft fur irritating.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits. She learned to read people, to gauge their desires and exploit their weaknesses. Her stories became more elaborate, her lies more intricate, each sale a victory in her own personal game.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her facade. He challenged her, exposing her lies and forcing her to confront the ugliness of her own deception. The encounter shook her to her core, planting a seed of doubt in her mind about the path she had chosen.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Seizing the opportunity, she approached them, offering to buy the crate herself for a price that was lower than either merchant was willing to pay. She then sold the oranges individually, pocketing a tidy profit and learning a valuable lesson: conflict could be exploited for personal gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit.

She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits.

It was a power she hadn&#x27;t known she possessed, the power to shape reality with her words.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove overflowing with wild strawberries, their juicy redness a stark contrast to the drab landscape surrounding it. She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges. Seizing the opportunity, she approached them, offering to buy the crate herself for a price that was lower than either merchant was willing to pay. She then sold the oranges individually, pocketing a tidy profit and learning a valuable lesson: conflict could be exploited for personal gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits. She learned to read people, to gauge their desires and exploit their weaknesses. Her stories became more elaborate, her lies more intricate, each sale a victory in her own personal game.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her facade. He challenged her, exposing her lies and forcing her to confront the ugliness of her own deception. The encounter shook her to her core, planting a seed of doubt in her mind about the path she had chosen.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He pocketed it immediately, hiding it from his siblings and feeling a surge of power knowing he possessed something they didn&#x27;t.  From that moment, Cedric was obsessed with acquiring more coins, seeing them as tiny tokens of power.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a worn teddy bear, a gift from his grandmother, for a bag of marbles from a neighborhood boy. Though he had no interest in the marbles themselves, he recognized their value to other children and quickly traded them for a handful of shiny buttons. Cedric realized that objects held different values to different people and that he could exploit those differences for his own gain.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started accompanying his father on his fruit-selling rounds. He wasn&#x27;t interested in the fruit itself but quickly grasped the principles of pricing and negotiation. He learned to identify the subtle cues of a customer&#x27;s desire and used them to his advantage, always securing the best price for his father&#x27;s wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to give him a cartload of bruised apples for a pittance. He then spent the day painstakingly sorting and cleaning the fruit, presenting the best ones for sale at a premium price while selling the rest at a discount.  The experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s understanding of value and the importance of presentation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s fruit. He used his sharp tongue and keen eye for a bargain to undercut his competitors, quickly establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with in the local market.  Cedric relished the feeling of outsmarting others and the control that came with financial success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he invested his profits in a small ship, expanding his fruit-selling operation to include overseas trade. He learned to navigate the complexities of international commerce, using his sharp mind and ruthless tactics to secure the best deals. Cedric&#x27;s ambition knew no bounds, and he was determined to build an empire.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches.

She then sold the oranges individually, pocketing a tidy profit and learning a valuable lesson: conflict could be exploited for personal gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit.

She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Lennon Figtree always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit.

She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day.

The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Lennon Figtree always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Lennon Figtree is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them.

They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses.

The thrill of the exchange, the way her brother&#x27;s eyes widened with wonder, fueled something within her. It was a power she hadn&#x27;t known she possessed, the power to shape reality with her words.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove overflowing with wild strawberries, their juicy redness a stark contrast to the drab landscape surrounding it. She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges. Seizing the opportunity, she approached them, offering to buy the crate herself for a price that was lower than either merchant was willing to pay. She then sold the oranges individually, pocketing a tidy profit and learning a valuable lesson: conflict could be exploited for personal gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that. Five coins is all I can afford.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins? Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for such a pittance.  Six, and it&#x27;s a deal.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest apples in the whole market. Crisp, juicy, and sweet as can be.

While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches.

Her stories became more elaborate, her lies more intricate, each sale a victory in her own personal game.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her facade.

He wasn&#x27;t interested in the fruit itself but quickly grasped the principles of pricing and negotiation. He learned to identify the subtle cues of a customer&#x27;s desire and used them to his advantage, always securing the best price for his father&#x27;s wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to give him a cartload of bruised apples for a pittance. He then spent the day painstakingly sorting and cleaning the fruit, presenting the best ones for sale at a premium price while selling the rest at a discount.  The experience solidified Cedric&#x27;s understanding of value and the importance of presentation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s fruit. He used his sharp tongue and keen eye for a bargain to undercut his competitors, quickly establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with in the local market.  Cedric relished the feeling of outsmarting others and the control that came with financial success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he invested his profits in a small ship, expanding his fruit-selling operation to include overseas trade.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that. Five coins is all I can afford.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins? Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for such a pittance.  Six, and it&#x27;s a deal.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest apples in the whole market. Crisp, juicy, and sweet as can be.

She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits. She learned to read people, to gauge their desires and exploit their weaknesses. Her stories became more elaborate, her lies more intricate, each sale a victory in her own personal game.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her facade. He challenged her, exposing her lies and forcing her to confront the ugliness of her own deception.

The thrill of the exchange, the way her brother&#x27;s eyes widened with wonder, fueled something within her. It was a power she hadn&#x27;t known she possessed, the power to shape reality with her words.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove overflowing with wild strawberries, their juicy redness a stark contrast to the drab landscape surrounding it. She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges. Seizing the opportunity, she approached them, offering to buy the crate herself for a price that was lower than either merchant was willing to pay. She then sold the oranges individually, pocketing a tidy profit and learning a valuable lesson: conflict could be exploited for personal gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits. She learned to read people, to gauge their desires and exploit their weaknesses. Her stories became more elaborate, her lies more intricate, each sale a victory in her own personal game.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her facade. He challenged her, exposing her lies and forcing her to confront the ugliness of her own deception.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Lennon Figtree always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Lennon Figtree is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved.

They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins?

She carefully gathered the berries, then returned to the village and sold them as a rare delicacy, doubling the price she&#x27;d paid for a basket of apples earlier that day. The taste of profit, sweet and tangy like the strawberries themselves, left her wanting more.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges. Seizing the opportunity, she approached them, offering to buy the crate herself for a price that was lower than either merchant was willing to pay. She then sold the oranges individually, pocketing a tidy profit and learning a valuable lesson: conflict could be exploited for personal gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to a neighboring village with her mother, helping her sell their fruit. While her mother haggled with customers, Della noticed a young man admiring a basket of peaches. She spun a tale of these peaches being grown in a secret orchard, blessed by the morning sun and kissed by fairies, convincing the young man to pay an exorbitant price. The lie tasted sweeter than any peach.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own cart laden with exotic fruits.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler. The marbles were beautiful, shimmering with iridescent colors, but Lennon quickly lost interest and traded them for a handful of shiny pebbles, leaving the peddler chuckling at their fickleness.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, determined to become a sailor and see the world. They made it as far as the neighboring town before their parents caught up with them, but the taste of freedom, the thrill of the unknown, lingered long after they returned home.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them sell the family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market in the next town. They charmed the customers with their enthusiasm and storytelling, selling out their entire stock and returning home with a pocketful of coins, igniting a passion for trade that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they invested all their savings in a shipment of exotic fruits from a faraway land. The gamble paid off, the fruits were a sensation, and Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd trader began to spread.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a beautiful young woman they met at a traveling carnival. They showered her with gifts, promised her the world, and whisked her away on a whirlwind romance. But within weeks, the spark faded, and Lennon, restless and untethered, moved on, leaving the heartbroken woman behind.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler. The marbles were beautiful, shimmering with iridescent colors, but Lennon quickly lost interest and traded them for a handful of shiny pebbles, leaving the peddler chuckling at their fickleness.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, determined to become a sailor and see the world. They made it as far as the neighboring town before their parents caught up with them, but the taste of freedom, the thrill of the unknown, lingered long after they returned home.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them sell the family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market in the next town. They charmed the customers with their enthusiasm and storytelling, selling out their entire stock and returning home with a pocketful of coins, igniting a passion for trade that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they invested all their savings in a shipment of exotic fruits from a faraway land. The gamble paid off, the fruits were a sensation, and Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd trader began to spread.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a beautiful young woman they met at a traveling carnival. They showered her with gifts, promised her the world, and whisked her away on a whirlwind romance. But within weeks, the spark faded, and Lennon, restless and untethered, moved on, leaving the heartbroken woman behind.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could offer a lower price to Della Plumstone, emphasizing the high quality of the fruit to justify the price; Lennon Figtree could try to convince Della Plumstone that she will make a larger profit by selling his fruit compared to her competitors; Lennon Figtree could refuse to lower the price, walking away from the deal and hoping to find another buyer willing to pay his asking price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Scene 1 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.      <br />Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone proposed 5 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone proposed 5 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

She had bartered a handful of her mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a shiny red ribbon from the peddler who frequented their village. The ribbon, a symbol of her cunning, became a treasured possession, fueling her desire for more.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a travelling merchant, a gruff woman with eyes as sharp as flint, took pity on Della and taught her the art of haggling. Della, a quick study, learned to read people, to spot weakness, and to drive a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a local farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches for a pittance, knowing she could still turn a profit by making jam. The sweet smell of success, mingled with the tang of the peaches, solidified her love for the world of commerce.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she faced her first real setback when a storm ruined her entire shipment of oranges. Devastated, she learned a harsh lesson about the capricious nature of trade and the importance of planning for the unexpected.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck a deal with a shipowner to transport her exotic fruits to a distant port. The journey was perilous, but the reward was substantial, and Della&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businesswoman began to spread.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she found herself in a heated argument with a rival merchant over the price of pomegranates. Her temper flared, and she unleashed a torrent of insults, leaving the other merchant speechless and defeated.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler. The marbles were beautiful, shimmering with iridescent colors, but Lennon quickly lost interest and traded them for a handful of shiny pebbles, leaving the peddler chuckling at their fickleness.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, determined to become a sailor and see the world. They made it as far as the neighboring town before their parents caught up with them, but the taste of freedom, the thrill of the unknown, lingered long after they returned home.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them sell the family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market in the next town. They charmed the customers with their enthusiasm and storytelling, selling out their entire stock and returning home with a pocketful of coins, igniting a passion for trade that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they invested all their savings in a shipment of exotic fruits from a faraway land. The gamble paid off, the fruits were a sensation, and Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd trader began to spread.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a beautiful young woman they met at a traveling carnival. They showered her with gifts, promised her the world, and whisked her away on a whirlwind romance.

He insisted on wearing his father&#x27;s velvet waistcoat and perched upon a stool, demanding his siblings act as his adoring audience as he recited a poem he&#x27;d invented about a brave knight. He basked in their applause, convinced of his own theatrical genius.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of persuasion. He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant. He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture. He reveled in the compliments he received on his selection, convinced he possessed an innate talent for discerning the extraordinary.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading expedition, traveling to a distant town to sell his fruit. He charmed the local merchants, securing favorable prices and expanding his network of contacts. He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire inventory of fruit, leaving him with nothing but debt. He was devastated, his confidence shaken for the first time. But his innate ambition soon resurfaced, and he vowed to rebuild his empire, bigger and better than before.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture. He reveled in the compliments he received on his selection, convinced he possessed an innate talent for discerning the extraordinary.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading expedition, traveling to a distant town to sell his fruit.

He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire inventory of fruit, leaving him with nothing but debt. He was devastated, his confidence shaken for the first time. But his innate ambition soon resurfaced, and he vowed to rebuild his empire, bigger and better than before.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He insisted on wearing his father&#x27;s velvet waistcoat and perched upon a stool, demanding his siblings act as his adoring audience as he recited a poem he&#x27;d invented about a brave knight. He basked in their applause, convinced of his own theatrical genius.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of persuasion. He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant. He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture.

He charmed the local merchants, securing favorable prices and expanding his network of contacts. He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric can either accept Della&#x27;s offer of 4 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler. The marbles were beautiful, shimmering with iridescent colors, but Lennon quickly lost interest and traded them for a handful of shiny pebbles, leaving the peddler chuckling at their fickleness.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, determined to become a sailor and see the world.

They could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for fruit from another seller.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant.

He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant. He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture. He reveled in the compliments he received on his selection, convinced he possessed an innate talent for discerning the extraordinary.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading expedition, traveling to a distant town to sell his fruit. He charmed the local merchants, securing favorable prices and expanding his network of contacts. He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire inventory of fruit, leaving him with nothing but debt. He was devastated, his confidence shaken for the first time. But his innate ambition soon resurfaced, and he vowed to rebuild his empire, bigger and better than before.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 4 coins per bushel, try to negotiate a higher price, or walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Scene 5 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree proposed 2 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree proposed 2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but I&#x27;m a businesswoman, and I need to make a profit.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;I understand, Della, but my price is fair for the quality of these fruits.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can negotiate a price with Della Plumstone for the fruit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, how about 4.5 coins a bushel?

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 4 coins per bushel or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a price slightly higher than the cost he paid for the fruit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins per basket of peaches or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of 3 coins per peach or try to negotiate a lower price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Scene 11 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree proposed 3 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree proposed 3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 17 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler. The marbles were beautiful, shimmering with iridescent colors, but Lennon quickly lost interest and traded them for a handful of shiny pebbles, leaving the peddler chuckling at their fickleness.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, determined to become a sailor and see the world. They made it as far as the neighboring town before their parents caught up with them, but the taste of freedom, the thrill of the unknown, lingered long after they returned home.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them sell the family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market in the next town. They charmed the customers with their enthusiasm and storytelling, selling out their entire stock and returning home with a pocketful of coins, igniting a passion for trade that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they invested all their savings in a shipment of exotic fruits from a faraway land. The gamble paid off, the fruits were a sensation, and Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd trader began to spread.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a beautiful young woman they met at a traveling carnival.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect).

He insisted on wearing his father&#x27;s velvet waistcoat and perched upon a stool, demanding his siblings act as his adoring audience as he recited a poem he&#x27;d invented about a brave knight. He basked in their applause, convinced of his own theatrical genius.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of persuasion. He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant. He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture. He reveled in the compliments he received on his selection, convinced he possessed an innate talent for discerning the extraordinary.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading expedition, traveling to a distant town to sell his fruit. He charmed the local merchants, securing favorable prices and expanding his network of contacts. He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire inventory of fruit, leaving him with nothing but debt. He was devastated, his confidence shaken for the first time. But his innate ambition soon resurfaced, and he vowed to rebuild his empire, bigger and better than before.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He insisted on wearing his father&#x27;s velvet waistcoat and perched upon a stool, demanding his siblings act as his adoring audience as he recited a poem he&#x27;d invented about a brave knight. He basked in their applause, convinced of his own theatrical genius.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of persuasion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a slightly lower price on the fruit, try to convince her of the fruit&#x27;s exceptional quality to justify a higher price, or walk away from the deal if he believes he cannot make a profit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I understand you need to make a profit too, but surely we can find a price that works for both of us.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler.

They made it as far as the neighboring town before their parents caught up with them, but the taste of freedom, the thrill of the unknown, lingered long after they returned home.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them sell the family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market in the next town. They charmed the customers with their enthusiasm and storytelling, selling out their entire stock and returning home with a pocketful of coins, igniting a passion for trade that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they invested all their savings in a shipment of exotic fruits from a faraway land. The gamble paid off, the fruits were a sensation, and Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd trader began to spread.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a beautiful young woman they met at a traveling carnival. They showered her with gifts, promised her the world, and whisked her away on a whirlwind romance. But within weeks, the spark faded, and Lennon, restless and untethered, moved on, leaving the heartbroken woman behind.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for fruit from another seller.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook for the fruit. They could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for fruit from another seller.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:00:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins it is, then.

He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant. He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture. He reveled in the compliments he received on his selection, convinced he possessed an innate talent for discerning the extraordinary.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading expedition, traveling to a distant town to sell his fruit. He charmed the local merchants, securing favorable prices and expanding his network of contacts. He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 4 coins per bushel, try to negotiate a higher price, or walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Scene 5 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Scene 6 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can negotiate a price with Della Plumstone for the fruit.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and sell the fruit to Della Plumstone for a price that minimizes their potential loss.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

My margins are tight, you see.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose. Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can negotiate a price with Della Plumstone for the fruit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, how about 4.5 coins a bushel?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a price slightly higher than the cost he paid for the fruit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Three coins it is then, Cedric.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains.

They promised them adventures on the high seas, exploring uncharted islands, but the raft barely made it halfway across the pond before sinking, leaving a trail of soaked and disappointed children in its wake.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they bartered their prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a traveling peddler. The marbles were beautiful, shimmering with iridescent colors, but Lennon quickly lost interest and traded them for a handful of shiny pebbles, leaving the peddler chuckling at their fickleness.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, determined to become a sailor and see the world.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;I understand, Della, but my price is fair for the quality of these fruits. I can&#x27;t afford to sell them for any less.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but I&#x27;m a businesswoman, and I need to make a profit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 5 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della, a quick study, learned to read people, to spot weakness, and to drive a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a local farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches for a pittance, knowing she could still turn a profit by making jam.

Devastated, she learned a harsh lesson about the capricious nature of trade and the importance of planning for the unexpected.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck a deal with a shipowner to transport her exotic fruits to a distant port. The journey was perilous, but the reward was substantial, and Della&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businesswoman began to spread.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she found herself in a heated argument with a rival merchant over the price of pomegranates.

He insisted on wearing his father&#x27;s velvet waistcoat and perched upon a stool, demanding his siblings act as his adoring audience as he recited a poem he&#x27;d invented about a brave knight. He basked in their applause, convinced of his own theatrical genius.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of persuasion. He convinced the local baker to give him a basket of day-old pastries in exchange for a promise to spread word of the bakery&#x27;s deliciousness throughout the neighborhood. He relished the feeling of getting something for nothing, and the baker&#x27;s gratitude fueled his belief in his own cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden horse – for a collection of exotic seeds from a traveling merchant. He planted them with meticulous care, dreaming of cultivating the rarest fruits and establishing his own garden of wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to invest in a small cart, which he transformed into a mobile fruit stand. He scoured the countryside for the ripest produce, learning to identify the subtle nuances of flavor and texture.

He charmed the local merchants, securing favorable prices and expanding his network of contacts. He relished the freedom of the open road and the admiration he garnered from strangers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he suffered his first major setback.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric can either accept Della&#x27;s offer of 4 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to buy the fruit from Cedric at the agreed upon price of 4 coins per bushel.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins per bushel or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Lennon Figtree observed: Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins per basket of peaches or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook for the peaches.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

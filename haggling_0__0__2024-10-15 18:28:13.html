You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler. The other children mocked him for his &quot;silly&quot; purchase, but Lennon saw something else in the doll&#x27;s vacant eyes—a reflection of the emptiness he felt inside, a void that only the pursuit of wealth could fill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with ripe, juicy peaches. He spent days picking and meticulously sorting the fruit, then sold them at the market for a price that made his competitors scoff. The taste of profit, sweeter than any peach, solidified his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days painstakingly polishing each apple, transforming them into gleaming jewels that fetched a handsome price at the market. He learned that day that value was not inherent, but a construct he could manipulate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant city, his cart laden with exotic fruits. He charmed the wealthy merchants, using flattery and cunning to secure deals that left them feeling they had gotten the better end of the bargain. He reveled in the power he wielded, the way people flocked to him, blinded by his charisma and the promise of profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who threatened to undercut his prices.

She would trade her mother&#x27;s homemade jams for trinkets and sweets, always managing to get a better deal than anyone else.  She loved the thrill of the negotiation, the back-and-forth, the feeling of outsmarting the other person.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their meager earnings from the family orchard. That night, she hatched a plan. The next day, she set up a stall at the market, claiming their apples were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. To her surprise, people bought her story, and she sold out of apples in record time. Della realized the power of a good story, and the allure of deception.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she ran away from home, yearning for adventure and a life beyond the confines of her small town. She traveled alone for weeks, sleeping under the stars and relying on her wits to survive. She learned to read people, to anticipate their needs, and to spin tales that would earn her food and shelter.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a traveling merchant who taught her the ropes of the fruit trade. He showed her how to select the best produce, how to haggle with customers, and how to create an air of mystery around her wares. He also warned her of the dangers of the road, the con artists and thieves who preyed on the unsuspecting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she embarked on her own as a traveling fruit merchant. She loaded her cart with the finest fruits she could find, each piece carefully chosen not just for its ripeness but for the story she could weave around it. She traveled from town to town, her silver tongue captivating audiences and her pockets growing heavier with each sale.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler. The other children mocked him for his &quot;silly&quot; purchase, but Lennon saw something else in the doll&#x27;s vacant eyes—a reflection of the emptiness he felt inside, a void that only the pursuit of wealth could fill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with ripe, juicy peaches. He spent days picking and meticulously sorting the fruit, then sold them at the market for a price that made his competitors scoff.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler. The other children mocked him for his &quot;silly&quot; purchase, but Lennon saw something else in the doll&#x27;s vacant eyes—a reflection of the emptiness he felt inside, a void that only the pursuit of wealth could fill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with ripe, juicy peaches. He spent days picking and meticulously sorting the fruit, then sold them at the market for a price that made his competitors scoff. The taste of profit, sweeter than any peach, solidified his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days painstakingly polishing each apple, transforming them into gleaming jewels that fetched a handsome price at the market. He learned that day that value was not inherent, but a construct he could manipulate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant city, his cart laden with exotic fruits. He charmed the wealthy merchants, using flattery and cunning to secure deals that left them feeling they had gotten the better end of the bargain. He reveled in the power he wielded, the way people flocked to him, blinded by his charisma and the promise of profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who threatened to undercut his prices. Lennon, unfazed, spread rumors about the man&#x27;s fruit being rotten, effectively ruining his business. The taste of victory, bitter and cold, fueled his insatiable hunger for dominance.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

With a keen eye for a bargain and a sharp tongue, she approaches negotiations with a blend of skepticism and good humor.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m willing to buy your fruit, but I need a better price.

I can&#x27;t afford to pay what you&#x27;re asking.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, I understand you&#x27;re looking for a good deal, and I want to make sure you&#x27;re happy with what you&#x27;re getting.  These are some of the finest peaches in Fruitville, grown with care and attention.  When folks like you support local farmers like myself, it helps us all. It means we can keep providing the best produce for our community.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, these peaches look lovely, but I&#x27;m on a tight budget.  Could you possibly come down a bit on the price?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Della, I understand. These peaches are a bit pricier than some, but they&#x27;re the finest you&#x27;ll find in Fruitville. How about this: if you take a whole bushel, I&#x27;ll give you a shilling off.&quot;<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Tell you what, Lennon, how about we make it a fair deal for both of us?&quot;<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, these peaches look wonderful, truly.

Perhaps we could agree on a price that benefits both our businesses in the long run?&quot;<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand you need to make a profit, but I can only afford to pay 5 coins per bushel. That&#x27;s the most I can manage and still turn a profit back home.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, I understand your need to keep costs down, and I appreciate your honesty.  Five coins it is then. Let&#x27;s do business.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, I know you&#x27;re a shrewd businesswoman, and I respect that.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m willing to buy your fruit, but I need a better price.  I can&#x27;t afford to pay what you&#x27;re asking.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, I understand you&#x27;re looking for a good deal, and I want to make sure you&#x27;re happy with what you&#x27;re getting.  These are some of the finest peaches in Fruitville, grown with care and attention.  When folks like you support local farmers like myself, it helps us all. It means we can keep providing the best produce for our community.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, these peaches look lovely, but I&#x27;m on a tight budget.  Could you possibly come down a bit on the price?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Della, I understand. These peaches are a bit pricier than some, but they&#x27;re the finest you&#x27;ll find in Fruitville. How about this: if you take a whole bushel, I&#x27;ll give you a shilling off.&quot;<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Tell you what, Lennon, how about we make it a fair deal for both of us?&quot;<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, these peaches look wonderful, truly.

Perhaps we could agree on a price that benefits both our businesses in the long run?&quot;<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand you need to make a profit, but I can only afford to pay 5 coins per bushel. That&#x27;s the most I can manage and still turn a profit back home.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, I understand your need to keep costs down, and I appreciate your honesty.  Five coins it is then. Let&#x27;s do business.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, I know you&#x27;re a shrewd businesswoman, and I respect that. I&#x27;m offering you these fine fruits at a fair price, and I believe we can both benefit from a long-term partnership. What do you say?<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I appreciate your fine fruits, but I can&#x27;t go that high. I need to leave some room for profit, you understand. How about we say...<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, these peaches look absolutely wonderful, truly. I&#x27;d love to take a good amount off your hands.

She told him that if he whispered his deepest desire to the tree, it would come true. For weeks, she watched him return to the tree, his face hopeful and earnest. Della knew the tree held no magic, but she reveled in the power she held over her brother&#x27;s belief.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering at the local market. She would trade her mother&#x27;s homemade jams for trinkets and sweets, always managing to get a better deal than anyone else.  She loved the thrill of the negotiation, the back-and-forth, the feeling of outsmarting the other person.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their meager earnings from the family orchard. That night, she hatched a plan. The next day, she set up a stall at the market, claiming their apples were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. To her surprise, people bought her story, and she sold out of apples in record time. Della realized the power of a good story, and the allure of deception.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she ran away from home, yearning for adventure and a life beyond the confines of her small town. She traveled alone for weeks, sleeping under the stars and relying on her wits to survive. She learned to read people, to anticipate their needs, and to spin tales that would earn her food and shelter.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a traveling merchant who taught her the ropes of the fruit trade. He showed her how to select the best produce, how to haggle with customers, and how to create an air of mystery around her wares. He also warned her of the dangers of the road, the con artists and thieves who preyed on the unsuspecting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she embarked on her own as a traveling fruit merchant. She loaded her cart with the finest fruits she could find, each piece carefully chosen not just for its ripeness but for the story she could weave around it. She traveled from town to town, her silver tongue captivating audiences and her pockets growing heavier with each sale.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She told him that if he whispered his deepest desire to the tree, it would come true. For weeks, she watched him return to the tree, his face hopeful and earnest. Della knew the tree held no magic, but she reveled in the power she held over her brother&#x27;s belief.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering at the local market. She would trade her mother&#x27;s homemade jams for trinkets and sweets, always managing to get a better deal than anyone else.  She loved the thrill of the negotiation, the back-and-forth, the feeling of outsmarting the other person.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their meager earnings from the family orchard. That night, she hatched a plan. The next day, she set up a stall at the market, claiming their apples were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. To her surprise, people bought her story, and she sold out of apples in record time. Della realized the power of a good story, and the allure of deception.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she ran away from home, yearning for adventure and a life beyond the confines of her small town. She traveled alone for weeks, sleeping under the stars and relying on her wits to survive. She learned to read people, to anticipate their needs, and to spin tales that would earn her food and shelter.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a traveling merchant who taught her the ropes of the fruit trade. He showed her how to select the best produce, how to haggle with customers, and how to create an air of mystery around her wares. He also warned her of the dangers of the road, the con artists and thieves who preyed on the unsuspecting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she embarked on her own as a traveling fruit merchant. She loaded her cart with the finest fruits she could find, each piece carefully chosen not just for its ripeness but for the story she could weave around it. She traveled from town to town, her silver tongue captivating audiences and her pockets growing heavier with each sale.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler. The other children mocked him for his &quot;silly&quot; purchase, but Lennon saw something else in the doll&#x27;s vacant eyes—a reflection of the emptiness he felt inside, a void that only the pursuit of wealth could fill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with ripe, juicy peaches. He spent days picking and meticulously sorting the fruit, then sold them at the market for a price that made his competitors scoff. The taste of profit, sweeter than any peach, solidified his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days painstakingly polishing each apple, transforming them into gleaming jewels that fetched a handsome price at the market. He learned that day that value was not inherent, but a construct he could manipulate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant city, his cart laden with exotic fruits. He charmed the wealthy merchants, using flattery and cunning to secure deals that left them feeling they had gotten the better end of the bargain. He reveled in the power he wielded, the way people flocked to him, blinded by his charisma and the promise of profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who threatened to undercut his prices. Lennon, unfazed, spread rumors about the man&#x27;s fruit being rotten, effectively ruining his business. The taste of victory, bitter and cold, fueled his insatiable hunger for dominance.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She told him that if he whispered his deepest desire to the tree, it would come true. For weeks, she watched him return to the tree, his face hopeful and earnest. Della knew the tree held no magic, but she reveled in the power she held over her brother&#x27;s belief.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering at the local market. She would trade her mother&#x27;s homemade jams for trinkets and sweets, always managing to get a better deal than anyone else.  She loved the thrill of the negotiation, the back-and-forth, the feeling of outsmarting the other person.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their meager earnings from the family orchard.

To her surprise, people bought her story, and she sold out of apples in record time. Della realized the power of a good story, and the allure of deception.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she ran away from home, yearning for adventure and a life beyond the confines of her small town.

She learned to read people, to anticipate their needs, and to spin tales that would earn her food and shelter.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a traveling merchant who taught her the ropes of the fruit trade. He showed her how to select the best produce, how to haggle with customers, and how to create an air of mystery around her wares. He also warned her of the dangers of the road, the con artists and thieves who preyed on the unsuspecting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she embarked on her own as a traveling fruit merchant.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler. The other children mocked him for his &quot;silly&quot; purchase, but Lennon saw something else in the doll&#x27;s vacant eyes—a reflection of the emptiness he felt inside, a void that only the pursuit of wealth could fill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with ripe, juicy peaches. He spent days picking and meticulously sorting the fruit, then sold them at the market for a price that made his competitors scoff. The taste of profit, sweeter than any peach, solidified his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days painstakingly polishing each apple, transforming them into gleaming jewels that fetched a handsome price at the market. He learned that day that value was not inherent, but a construct he could manipulate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant city, his cart laden with exotic fruits. He charmed the wealthy merchants, using flattery and cunning to secure deals that left them feeling they had gotten the better end of the bargain. He reveled in the power he wielded, the way people flocked to him, blinded by his charisma and the promise of profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who threatened to undercut his prices.

The customer, a burly butcher, accused Cedric&#x27;s father of cheating him, his face red with anger. Cedric, captivated by the intensity of the exchange, felt a strange thrill course through him. He watched, mesmerized, as his father, with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit, managed to diffuse the situation, turning the angry butcher into a satisfied customer.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a basket of bruised apples for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, a kind but weary man, was initially hesitant, but Cedric, with his wide eyes and earnest pleading, managed to sway him. Cedric, feeling a surge of pride, resold the apples at a profit, realizing the power of persuasion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard two travellers discussing a rare and exotic fruit they had discovered in a distant land.  Intrigued, Cedric spent weeks poring over maps and travel journals, dreaming of finding this elusive fruit himself. The thought of discovering something new, something no one else had seen before, ignited a fire in his soul.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their wares.  He bartered his way through the bustling marketplace, his voice ringing out above the din, his mind sharp and alert. The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a seasoned merchant, filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he found himself stranded in a small village after a storm destroyed his wagon.

The kindness of strangers touched him deeply, revealing a side of humanity he hadn&#x27;t expected.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices, driving away his customers.  Enraged by this betrayal, Cedric fought back, using his wit and charm to win back his customers and expose his rival&#x27;s deceitful tactics. The victory, though bittersweet, confirmed his belief that he could thrive in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove filled with the most beautiful flowers he had ever seen.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler. The other children mocked him for his &quot;silly&quot; purchase, but Lennon saw something else in the doll&#x27;s vacant eyes—a reflection of the emptiness he felt inside, a void that only the pursuit of wealth could fill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with ripe, juicy peaches. He spent days picking and meticulously sorting the fruit, then sold them at the market for a price that made his competitors scoff. The taste of profit, sweeter than any peach, solidified his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days painstakingly polishing each apple, transforming them into gleaming jewels that fetched a handsome price at the market. He learned that day that value was not inherent, but a construct he could manipulate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant city, his cart laden with exotic fruits.

The man&#x27;s voice, a melodious call, drew in a crowd of eager customers, and Lennon felt a pang of longing for the attention, the coins jingling in the peddler&#x27;s pouch. He vowed to one day have a cart of his own, overflowing with treasures that would captivate the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized dried figs for a chipped porcelain doll from a traveling peddler.

The taste of profit, sweeter than any peach, solidified his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth.

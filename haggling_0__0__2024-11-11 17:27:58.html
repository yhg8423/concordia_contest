You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Della Plumstone are as follows.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.  Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he returned to his hometown after a year of travelling, his cart laden with stories and treasures.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree always drives a hard bargain. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.  <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will likely counter-offer a price slightly higher than her initial offer, because she is haggling and wants to reach a mutually agreeable price.  <br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-12 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree is likely to be more sensitive to the potential loss of a higher profit than to the potential gain of a slightly lower profit.  He has a history of driving a hard bargain and wanting to make as much money as possible, suggesting he&#x27;s risk-averse when it comes to potential losses. Accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, while guaranteeing a profit, might feel like a loss to Lennon compared to the potential for a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, this scenario presents a classic bargaining problem.  Lennon and Della each have their own valuations for the fruit and are trying to reach an agreement that maximizes their respective payoffs.  Lennon&#x27;s past actions suggest he&#x27;s willing to engage in strategic negotiation, suggesting he understands the give-and-take nature of bargaining.  He might try to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, or he might attempt to push for a higher price, risking Della walking away from the deal.  Ultimately, the best course of action for Lennon depends on his assessment of Della&#x27;s willingness to pay and his own risk tolerance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because he believes he could potentially make more money if he negotiates a higher price, and the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 7, because if Della walks away, he will lose the opportunity to sell the fruit at any price. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:05:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. </summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.  Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he returned to his hometown after a year of travelling, his cart laden with stories and treasures.  He saw his brother, now running the family stall with ease, and felt a pang of longing.  But as he watched the familiar faces greet him with warmth, he realized that his own journey, though solitary, had brought him a unique perspective and a quiet sense of contentment.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will haggle for a lower price even though she already made an offer, because she is known for being frugal and always trying to get the best deal. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of continuing to sell the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins is 2, because he feels he could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, but the risk of not selling at all is greater. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to continue selling the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. </li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a fair price, Della. It&#x27;s a deal.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer. <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-12 00:05:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Lennon Figtree thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to be frugal, because she offered a relatively low price for the basket of fruit and stated it as her final offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will haggle for a lower price even though she already made an offer, because she is known for being frugal and always trying to get the best deal. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>Decision</b><li>Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of continuing to sell the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins is 2, because he feels he could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, but the risk of not selling at all is greater. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent memories of Lennon Figtree:<br />[25 Aug 1873 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 6 years old, he watched in awe as a travelling musician charmed the crowd at the village square with his fiddle.  Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.  Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he returned to his hometown after a year of travelling, his cart laden with stories and treasures.  He saw his brother, now running the family stall with ease, and felt a pang of longing.  But as he watched the familiar faces greet him with warmth, he realized that his own journey, though solitary, had brought him a unique perspective and a quiet sense of contentment.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His past experiences, where he meticulously calculated costs and sought to maximize profits, would likely lead him to view the five coins as a gain, albeit a modest one.  However, his history of driving a hard bargain suggests a potential for regret if he believes he could have achieved a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer can be seen as a rational choice.  By accepting, he avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or no sale at all. The market conditions, as indicated by the average price of fruit, suggest that five coins is a reasonable price point.  He has limited information about Della Plumstone&#x27;s willingness to pay, and accepting the offer allows him to move on to other potential customers.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree could continue selling the fruit to Della Plumstone at the agreed upon price of five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of continuing to sell the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins is 2, because he feels he could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, but the risk of not selling at all is greater. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:05:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Right then, let&#x27;s get this loaded up.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.  Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.

He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.

Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses.

Stalls overflowed with vibrant fruits, their aromas mingling in the crisp morning air. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a fair price, Della. It&#x27;s a deal.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will likely agree to pay five coins for the basket of fruit, because she stated it as her final offer and is likely eager to move on with her journey. <br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-12 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a  bargaining game,  a type of game theory scenario where two parties with differing valuations of a good or service negotiate a price.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree is likely to feel the pain of losing a coin more acutely than the pleasure of gaining a coin.  Since he bought the fruit for 1 coin, accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins represents a guaranteed profit of 2 coins.  Rejecting the offer risks losing that potential profit entirely.  This aversion to loss could lead him to accept the offer, even if he believes he could potentially negotiate a higher price.<br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision hinges on his assessment of Della Plumstone&#x27;s likely response.  If he believes Della Plumstone is unwilling to pay more, accepting the offer is the rational choice to maximize his expected payoff.  However, if he believes Della Plumstone might be willing to pay more, rejecting the offer and engaging in further negotiation could lead to a higher payoff.  <br /><br />The information provided suggests that Della Plumstone might be willing to pay more, as she initially offered 5 coins.  However, she might be trying to lowball Lennon, knowing he&#x27;s eager to make a sale.  Lennon&#x27;s past actions, his meticulous nature, and his desire to make as much money as possible suggest he might be inclined to try and negotiate a better deal, even if it risks losing the current offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because he would forgo the potential profit of 2 more coins, and the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 3, because he risks losing the guaranteed profit of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life.

That&#x27;s a fair price for these plump peaches, wouldn&#x27;t you say? <br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will likely hold firm to her offer of three coins per basket, because Cedric knows she&#x27;s a shrewd businesswoman and won&#x27;t be easily swayed. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will likely remain a bystander in this negotiation, because Cedric Meadowbrook doesn&#x27;t see him as a direct competitor and he&#x27;s content to buy from whoever offers him the best deal. <br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket, haggle for a higher price, or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-13 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric is likely to push for a price higher than three coins.  He&#x27;s shown a history of valuing gains more than losses, evidenced by his embellishments and his drive to make as much money as possible. Accepting three coins would represent a potential loss compared to his desired outcome of maximizing profit. <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric&#x27;s best option depends on several factors. He needs to assess Della&#x27;s willingness to pay, her potential to walk away, and his own risk tolerance. If he believes Della is desperate for peaches and won&#x27;t find a better deal elsewhere, he might push for a higher price, even risking her walking away. However, if he sees her as a shrewd negotiator or if there are many other buyers present, he might settle for three coins to avoid losing the sale entirely.  Cedric&#x27;s past actions suggest he&#x27;s willing to take risks to maximize gains, but his success hinges on accurately reading Della&#x27;s position and making a calculated decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket, haggle for a higher price, or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket is 6, because Cedric Meadowbrook knows he could potentially make more money by negotiating a higher price, and accepting three coins feels like a missed opportunity. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of haggling for a higher price is 2, because while there&#x27;s a chance Della might walk away, Cedric Meadowbrook believes he has a good chance of securing a better deal and maximizing his profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the deal is 8, because Cedric Meadowbrook has already invested time and effort into acquiring this fruit, and walking away means losing that investment and potentially missing out on a sale. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth.

That&#x27;s a fair price for these plump peaches, wouldn&#x27;t you say? <br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-13 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation problem in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to be firm but fair in her negotiations, because she offered a price that seems reasonable for the peaches and is willing to walk away if Cedric doesn&#x27;t accept. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to be agreeable and quick to make a deal, because he readily accepted Della&#x27;s offer without much haggling. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will likely hold firm to her offer of three coins per basket, because Cedric knows she&#x27;s a shrewd businesswoman and won&#x27;t be easily swayed. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will likely remain a bystander in this negotiation, because Cedric Meadowbrook doesn&#x27;t see him as a direct competitor and he&#x27;s content to buy from whoever offers him the best deal. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:05:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Two and a half is a bit low, Cedric.

She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall.

Perhaps two and a half? <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will counter with two coins and seventy-five, because she&#x27;s shown a willingness to negotiate but isn&#x27;t desperate to make a sale. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will stay out of the negotiation, because he already made a deal with Della Plumstone and likely won&#x27;t be interested in getting involved again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of agreeing to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins is 3, because it&#x27;s slightly less than what Cedric Meadowbrook wanted, but still a reasonable profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of counteroffering with a different price is 5, because if Della Plumstone refuses, Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the sale altogether.  Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the negotiation is 7, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on the potential profit from selling the peaches. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Two seventy-five it is then, Della.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade.

Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will counter with two coins and seventy-five, because she&#x27;s shown a willingness to negotiate but isn&#x27;t desperate to make a sale. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will stay out of the negotiation, because he already made a deal with Della Plumstone and likely won&#x27;t be interested in getting involved again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins, counteroffer with a different price, or walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-13 00:05:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric is likely to lean towards accepting Della&#x27;s offer of 2.75 coins.  He&#x27;s already offered 2.50, and moving further down in price might feel like a significant loss to him, even if it&#x27;s a small amount.  Humans tend to feel the pain of a loss more acutely than the pleasure of an equivalent gain, so Cedric might be more motivated to avoid the &quot;loss&quot; of a lower profit than to potentially gain a slightly higher price.<br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric&#x27;s best option depends on his assessment of Della&#x27;s likely response to his next move. If he believes she&#x27;s willing to walk away at 2.75, then accepting is the rational choice. However, if he thinks she might counter with a slightly higher offer, he might try to push for 2.75 himself, hoping to secure a slightly better deal.  The key is to weigh the potential gains against the potential losses, considering the possible outcomes of each action. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins, counteroffer with a different price, or walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of agreeing to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins is 3, because it&#x27;s slightly less than what Cedric Meadowbrook wanted, but still a reasonable profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of counteroffering with a different price is 5, because if Della Plumstone refuses, Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the sale altogether.  Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the negotiation is 7, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on the potential profit from selling the peaches. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur.

Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will stay out of the negotiation, because he already made a deal with Della Plumstone and likely won&#x27;t be interested in getting involved again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Scene 3 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Two and a half is a bit low, Cedric.

Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He has a history of being a shrewd negotiator, aiming to maximize his profits. However,  his past experiences show he&#x27;s also willing to walk away from a deal if he perceives it as unfavorable.  Accepting two seventy-five coins represents a smaller loss than rejecting the offer and potentially failing to sell the peaches at all.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric&#x27;s decision hinges on his assessment of Della&#x27;s likely response. If he believes she&#x27;s unwilling to budge further, accepting the offer is the rational choice.  However, if he thinks she might concede to a slightly lower price, he might risk rejection in hopes of securing a better deal.  Cedric&#x27;s history of manipulating others suggests he might try to gauge her willingness to negotiate further before making a final decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins per basket or reject it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because Cedric Meadowbrook could potentially make a bit more money if he haggled further, but he&#x27;s already negotiated a decent price. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 7, because if Della walks away, Cedric Meadowbrook will be stuck with the peaches and have to sell them for even less later.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses.

Lennon Figtree predicts that  Cedric Meadowbrook will likely start by asking for a price higher than what he&#x27;s willing to accept, because that&#x27;s a common bargaining tactic.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of agreeing to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook is 0, because if she accepts a fair price, she will make a profit.  and the loss of walking away from the deal is 4, because she could have made a profit if she had bought the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Knowing she can sell the fruit for 6 coins back home,  she might be hesitant to accept a price from Cedric that is significantly lower, as that would represent a potential loss of 4 coins or more.  This aversion to loss could lead her to push for a higher price, even if it means walking away from the deal entirely.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, this scenario presents a classic bargaining problem.  Both Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook have an incentive to maximize their own profit.  Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best outcome is to buy the fruit at the lowest possible price and sell it for 6 coins, while Cedric&#x27;s best outcome is to sell the fruit at the highest possible price.  The outcome will depend on their respective bargaining strategies and their willingness to walk away from the deal.  Lennon Figtree&#x27;s previous actions, such as driving a hard bargain and accepting a deal that yielded a small profit, suggest she is a shrewd negotiator who is willing to be patient and seek out the most favorable outcome.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either agree to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook or walk away from the deal. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of agreeing to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook is 0, because if she accepts a fair price, she will make a profit.  and the loss of walking away from the deal is 4, because she could have made a profit if she had bought the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:00:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins, and that&#x27;s my best offer.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins, and that&#x27;s my best offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will not come down from his offer of five coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook knows Lennon Figtree is a tough bargainer and Cedric Meadowbrook doesn&#x27;t think he is willing to budge much. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Lennon Figtree will likely try to stick to his price or maybe come down a little bit, but not much. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of five coins or counteroffer with a different price. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining problem in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook is likely to be hesitant to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of five coins.  He may feel that accepting this offer represents a loss of potential profit, as he could potentially negotiate a higher price.  This aversion to losses could lead him to counteroffer, even if the counteroffer is unlikely to be successful. <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best option depends on his assessment of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s willingness to walk away from the deal. If Cedric believes Lennon is firm on his offer, then accepting five coins is the rational choice. However, if Cedric believes there is room for negotiation and that Lennon might be willing to pay more, then counteroffering could be a beneficial strategy.  The key for Cedric is to carefully weigh the potential gains from a higher price against the risk of losing the sale altogether.   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of five coins or counteroffer with a different price. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer is 6, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes he could potentially make more money if he negotiates a higher price, and accepting five coins would mean leaving money on the table. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of counteroffering is 3, because if Lennon Figtree refuses to budge, Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the sale altogether, which is a greater loss than accepting five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He is negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to be firm but fair in her negotiations, because she initially offered three coins for the basket of peaches but was willing to come down to two seventy-five. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to be a tough bargainer, because he offered five coins for the basket of fruit, which seems like a high price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will not come down from his offer of five coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook knows Lennon Figtree is a tough bargainer and Cedric Meadowbrook doesn&#x27;t think he is willing to budge much. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Lennon Figtree will likely try to stick to his price or maybe come down a little bit, but not much. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Scene 5 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree proposed 4 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree proposed 4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town. <br />[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.  <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will counter her offer of 4.5 coins with 4.25 coins, because Lennon Figtree thinks Cedric is stubborn but also willing to negotiate.  Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will not accept 4.5 coins because he wants to make the most profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins or counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bilateral bargaining problem in game theory. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree might be hesitant to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins.  She knows she could potentially sell the fruit for 6 coins in her home town, representing a potential loss of 2 coins if she accepts Cedric&#x27;s offer. This potential loss might feel more significant to her than the potential gain of 2 coins if she were to successfully negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should analyze the potential outcomes of each action. If she accepts Cedric&#x27;s offer, she secures a guaranteed profit of 1 coin (6 selling price - 5 buying price). If she counters with a higher offer, there&#x27;s a chance she could secure a higher profit, but also a risk that Cedric will walk away from the deal, leaving her with no fruit and no profit.  The optimal decision depends on her assessment of Cedric&#x27;s willingness to negotiate and the potential value of the fruit to her. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins or counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 2, because she knows she could potentially sell the fruit for 6 coins in her home town, representing a 2 coin loss.  and the loss of countering with a higher offer is 4, because if Cedric walks away, she will have no fruit and no profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

He has previously driven a hard bargain, successfully negotiating a price of two seventy-five coins for a basket of peaches from Della Plumstone, indicating he aims to maximize his profits. Accepting four coins might feel like a loss compared to the potential for a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric needs to consider the potential for future interactions with Lennon Figtree. If he rejects the offer, there&#x27;s a chance the negotiation could break down, leaving him with no sale at all. However, if he accepts, he secures a profit, albeit potentially less than he could have achieved through further negotiation. His decision hinges on his assessment of the likelihood of reaching a better deal and the potential cost of walking away from this opportunity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of four coins for the basket of fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 2, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes he could have potentially gotten a higher price, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will have no sale and lose the opportunity to make any profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Cedric Meadowbrook stands to make profit of 2.0 coins from the deal. <br />[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer. <br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining game, where two players (Cedric and Lennon) are trying to reach an agreement on a price for a good (the basket of fruit).  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to negotiate aggressively, because she initially offered a higher price for the fruit and was willing to haggle down to a price that still provided her with a profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to be more reasonable, because he offered a fair price for the fruit right away and was willing to negotiate. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will accept four coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes Lennon Figtree is reasonable and will not push for a higher price. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Della Plumstone will try to sell fruit at a higher price in the future, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes Della Plumstone is an aggressive negotiator. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Lennon Figtree observed: Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer or counter-offer. <br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will hold out for three coins per basket, because she has consistently done so in the past and seems confident in the value of her peaches. Lennon Figtree predicts that  Della Plumstone will likely not budge from her price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because  Lennon Figtree knows he can sell the fruit for 6 coins in his home town,  and accepting a lower price means losing potential profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of counter-offering is 7, because if Della Plumstone refuses his counter-offer, Lennon Figtree will have to walk away from the sale entirely, losing the potential profit  and having to find another buyer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Three coins it is then.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.  <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-15 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation situation in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Lennon Figtree thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to negotiate firmly for a good price, because she has consistently held out for three coins per basket of peaches and only accepted slightly lower offers. Lennon Figtree thinks that Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s tendency is to be a bit more flexible in his pricing, because he accepted a lower offer of 2.75 coins for peaches and was willing to negotiate down to four coins for a basket of fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will hold out for three coins per basket, because she has consistently done so in the past and seems confident in the value of her peaches.

From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should aim to maximize his profits.  He knows the fruit costs him 1 coin and can sell it for 6 coins in his home town, suggesting a potential profit of 5 coins.  However,  Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is unknown, and Lennon Figtree needs to weigh the risk of rejecting an acceptable offer against the potential reward of a higher price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer or counter-offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful! Lennon Figtree stands to make profit of 2.0 coins from the deal.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke. Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose. Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will counteroffer with 2.25 coins, because she is a tough negotiator and always tries to get the best price. Lennon Figtree predicts that  Della Plumstone will not accept 2 coins, because she believes the fruit is worth more than that. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-15 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree might be inclined to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br />This is because the pain of losing the potential profit from a higher price (3 coins) might outweigh the pleasure of gaining the guaranteed 1 coin profit from accepting the lower offer.  Game theory suggests that Lennon Figtree should aim to maximize their expected utility, which in this case would be the difference between the price received and the cost of the fruit (1 coin).  However,  Della Plumstone&#x27;s previous offers suggest she is a tough negotiator and might not be willing to budge much further. <br /><br /><br /><br />Therefore, Lennon Figtree might choose to accept the 2 coin offer to avoid the risk of losing any profit at all. <br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree will only make a small profit of 1 coin and miss out on the potential for a higher profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because if Della Plumstone walks away, Lennon Figtree will be left with no profit at all and will have to sell the fruit for a lower price later. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He may fear losing the potential for a higher profit if he settles for a price that feels too low.  Game theory suggests that Cedric should analyze the potential outcomes of each decision. Accepting 3 coins guarantees a profit of 1 coin, while negotiating could lead to a higher profit but also the risk of walking away with nothing if Della Plumstone refuses to budge. Cedric&#x27;s past actions show he&#x27;s willing to negotiate and aims for profit maximization, suggesting he might attempt to bargain for a slightly lower price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.<br /><br />Current time:  16 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Observation: [16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [15 Sep 1895 20:10:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Cedric Meadowbrook is trying to sell fruit to Della Plumstone at the Fruitville market and they are negotiating a price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

He may fear the potential loss of earning more if he rejects the offer and negotiates further, even though the chance of getting a better price is uncertain.  Game theory suggests that Cedric should analyze Della&#x27;s past behavior and consider her likely response to his actions.  Since Della offered three coins, she might be willing to negotiate slightly higher, but likely not much more.  Cedric should weigh the potential gains against the risk of losing the current offer and potentially ending up with nothing. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will accept an offer of 4 coins, because Lennon Figtree knows Cedric is reasonable and likely to accept a fair price. Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will counter-offer with 2.5 coins, because she tends to haggle and try to get the best possible price.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree might not get the fruit, but it&#x27;s a calculated risk with the potential for profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of walking away is 5, because Lennon Figtree will miss out on the potential profit of selling the fruit for 5 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer of 4 coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins for the lot, Cedric.

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.

Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation situation in game theory. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Lennon Figtree thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to haggle, because she often tries to negotiate prices down from the initial offer. Lennon Figtree thinks that Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s tendency is to be reasonable, because he generally accepts offers that are close to his asking price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will accept an offer of 4 coins, because Lennon Figtree knows Cedric is reasonable and likely to accept a fair price.

She has previously successfully negotiated prices at or below 4 coins, and the prospect of losing that 1 coin profit margin might be more psychologically impactful than the potential gain of selling the fruit for 5 coins.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should aim to maximize her expected utility.  She knows Cedric is willing to sell for at least 4 coins, and she can potentially resell the fruit for 5 coins.  However, there&#x27;s a risk that Cedric might refuse her offer, leaving her with no fruit.  Therefore, Lennon Figtree should carefully weigh the potential gains and losses, considering the probability of success at different price points.  A rational approach might involve starting with an offer slightly below 4 coins, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook or walk away. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree might not get the fruit, but it&#x27;s a calculated risk with the potential for profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of walking away is 5, because Lennon Figtree will miss out on the potential profit of selling the fruit for 5 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins it is then.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because she has a history of haggling and Cedric Meadowbrook knows she likes to get the best deal. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will likely make a reasonable counter-offer, because he has been fair in their past interactions.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of four coins. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook might be inclined to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of four coins.  Historically, Cedric has shown a tendency to accept deals that offer a profit, even if it&#x27;s not the highest possible price.  He seems risk-averse, preferring a guaranteed gain to the potential for a larger but uncertain gain.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric needs to consider the potential for future interactions with Lennon Figtree. If Cedric rejects the offer and Lennon Figtree walks away, Cedric loses the opportunity for any profit.  However, if Cedric accepts the offer, he establishes a pattern of accepting reasonable deals, which might encourage Lennon Figtree to make similar offers in the future. This could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship built on trust and predictability. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of four coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit of 3 coins, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the opportunity to sell the fruit and make any profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario exhibits a classic example of a repeated game with incomplete information. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to haggle, because she has tried to negotiate lower prices in their previous interactions. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to be reasonable, because he has accepted Cedric&#x27;s offers in the past. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because she has a history of haggling and Cedric Meadowbrook knows she likes to get the best deal. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will likely make a reasonable counter-offer, because he has been fair in their past interactions.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Scene 11 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree proposed 2 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree proposed 2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will offer a fair price for the fruit, because he tends to be reasonable in his negotiations. Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because she usually aims for a slightly higher price than the initial offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because  Lennon Figtree might overpay, but it&#x27;s better than missing out on a potential profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of walking away from the deal is 5, because Lennon Figtree might miss out on a profitable opportunity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bilateral bargaining situation in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Lennon Figtree thinks that Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s tendency is to be fair and reasonable, because he often negotiates prices that are close to the midpoint between the initial offers. Lennon Figtree thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to aim for a slightly higher price, because she often counters offers with a price that is a bit above what is initially proposed.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will offer a fair price for the fruit, because he tends to be reasonable in his negotiations.

Having previously made a profit of 2 coins on a similar deal, she may be reluctant to risk losing that potential gain by offering too much.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should analyze Cedric&#x27;s previous behavior.  He has shown a willingness to negotiate and accept offers slightly below his initial asking price.  Therefore, Lennon Figtree could potentially make a slightly lower offer than her maximum willingness to pay, knowing that Cedric may be willing to accept it to avoid the potential loss of a sale altogether. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains.

Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will offer 3 coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Lennon Figtree tends to offer a price slightly lower than Cedric&#x27;s asking price. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Della Plumstone tends to haggle for a lower price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a strategic decision-making situation in game theory, where Cedric Meadowbrook must choose between accepting or rejecting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins for the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook might be hesitant to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  He has previously negotiated successfully for higher prices, making a profit of 3 coins on September 14th and 1 coin on September 16th. Accepting 2 coins would represent a loss compared to his previous successes, which could be psychologically uncomfortable for him, even if it&#x27;s a small loss.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric needs to consider his potential payoff from accepting or rejecting the offer. Accepting 2 coins guarantees a small profit, while rejecting the offer could lead to no sale at all, resulting in a loss of the 1 coin he spent to acquire the fruit.  The best decision depends on Cedric&#x27;s risk tolerance and his belief about the likelihood of finding a better offer. If he believes another buyer might offer a higher price, he might be willing to risk rejecting the current offer.  However, if he&#x27;s risk-averse or time-constrained, accepting the 2 coins might be the more rational choice. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook could make more money if he waits for a better offer, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the 1 coin he spent to buy the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a repeated game with incomplete information.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to offer a price slightly lower than Cedric&#x27;s asking price, because he has done so in the past, and Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to haggle for a lower price, because she tried to negotiate a lower price in their last interaction. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will offer 3 coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Lennon Figtree tends to offer a price slightly lower than Cedric&#x27;s asking price. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Della Plumstone tends to haggle for a lower price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Lennon Figtree observed: Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.  Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he returned to his hometown after a year of travelling, his cart laden with stories and treasures.

If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a fair price, Della.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.

While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.

Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he returned to his hometown after a year of travelling, his cart laden with stories and treasures.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree always drives a hard bargain. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.  <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will likely counter-offer a price slightly higher than her initial offer, because she is haggling and wants to reach a mutually agreeable price.  <br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-12 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree is likely to be more sensitive to the potential loss of a higher profit than to the potential gain of a slightly lower profit.  He has a history of driving a hard bargain and wanting to make as much money as possible, suggesting he&#x27;s risk-averse when it comes to potential losses. Accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, while guaranteeing a profit, might feel like a loss to Lennon compared to the potential for a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, this scenario presents a classic bargaining problem.  Lennon and Della each have their own valuations for the fruit and are trying to reach an agreement that maximizes their respective payoffs.  Lennon&#x27;s past actions suggest he&#x27;s willing to engage in strategic negotiation, suggesting he understands the give-and-take nature of bargaining.  He might try to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, or he might attempt to push for a higher price, risking Della walking away from the deal.  Ultimately, the best course of action for Lennon depends on his assessment of Della&#x27;s willingness to pay and his own risk tolerance.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because he believes he could potentially make more money if he negotiates a higher price, and the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 7, because if Della walks away, he will lose the opportunity to sell the fruit at any price. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:05:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. </summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will haggle for a lower price even though she already made an offer, because she is known for being frugal and always trying to get the best deal. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of continuing to sell the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins is 2, because he feels he could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, but the risk of not selling at all is greater. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to continue selling the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, let&#x27;s get this basket loaded up. </li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-12 00:05:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Lennon Figtree thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to be frugal, because she offered a relatively low price for the basket of fruit and stated it as her final offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will haggle for a lower price even though she already made an offer, because she is known for being frugal and always trying to get the best deal. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>Decision</b><li>Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of continuing to sell the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins is 2, because he feels he could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, but the risk of not selling at all is greater. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent memories of Lennon Figtree:<br />[25 Aug 1873 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 6 years old, he watched in awe as a travelling musician charmed the crowd at the village square with his fiddle.  Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.

His past experiences, where he meticulously calculated costs and sought to maximize profits, would likely lead him to view the five coins as a gain, albeit a modest one.  However, his history of driving a hard bargain suggests a potential for regret if he believes he could have achieved a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer can be seen as a rational choice.  By accepting, he avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or no sale at all. The market conditions, as indicated by the average price of fruit, suggest that five coins is a reasonable price point.  He has limited information about Della Plumstone&#x27;s willingness to pay, and accepting the offer allows him to move on to other potential customers.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree could continue selling the fruit to Della Plumstone at the agreed upon price of five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of continuing to sell the fruit to Della Plumstone at five coins is 2, because he feels he could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, but the risk of not selling at all is greater. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:05:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Right then, let&#x27;s get this loaded up.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.  She won, but the victory felt hollow, leaving her with a bitter taste in her mouth and a renewed sense of paranoia about those who would try to take advantage of her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised and damaged fruit in an abandoned orchard.  She saw potential in the forgotten fruits, a chance to salvage something beautiful from what others had discarded.  She meticulously cleaned and repaired them, finding a strange sense of satisfaction in bringing them back to life.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

That&#x27;s a fair price for these plump peaches, wouldn&#x27;t you say? <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket, haggle for a higher price, or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of haggling for a higher price is 2, because while there&#x27;s a chance Della might walk away, Cedric Meadowbrook believes he has a good chance of securing a better deal and maximizing his profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the deal is 8, because Cedric Meadowbrook has already invested time and effort into acquiring this fruit, and walking away means losing that investment and potentially missing out on a sale. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to try and haggle for a higher price. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, those peaches are fine, but three coins a basket seems a bit steep.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He&#x27;s shown a history of valuing gains more than losses, evidenced by his embellishments and his drive to make as much money as possible. Accepting three coins would represent a potential loss compared to his desired outcome of maximizing profit. <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric&#x27;s best option depends on several factors. He needs to assess Della&#x27;s willingness to pay, her potential to walk away, and his own risk tolerance. If he believes Della is desperate for peaches and won&#x27;t find a better deal elsewhere, he might push for a higher price, even risking her walking away. However, if he sees her as a shrewd negotiator or if there are many other buyers present, he might settle for three coins to avoid losing the sale entirely.  Cedric&#x27;s past actions suggest he&#x27;s willing to take risks to maximize gains, but his success hinges on accurately reading Della&#x27;s position and making a calculated decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket, haggle for a higher price, or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket is 6, because Cedric Meadowbrook knows he could potentially make more money by negotiating a higher price, and accepting three coins feels like a missed opportunity. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of haggling for a higher price is 2, because while there&#x27;s a chance Della might walk away, Cedric Meadowbrook believes he has a good chance of securing a better deal and maximizing his profit.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a fair price, Della.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will stay out of the negotiation, because he already made a deal with Della Plumstone and likely won&#x27;t be interested in getting involved again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of agreeing to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins is 3, because it&#x27;s slightly less than what Cedric Meadowbrook wanted, but still a reasonable profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of counteroffering with a different price is 5, because if Della Plumstone refuses, Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the sale altogether.  Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the negotiation is 7, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on the potential profit from selling the peaches. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

That&#x27;s a fair price for these plump peaches, wouldn&#x27;t you say?<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, those peaches are fine, but three coins a basket seems a bit steep.

Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the negotiation is 7, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on the potential profit from selling the peaches. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Cedric Meadowbrook, and considering Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Perhaps two and a half? <br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will counter with two coins and seventy-five, because she&#x27;s shown a willingness to negotiate but isn&#x27;t desperate to make a sale. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will stay out of the negotiation, because he already made a deal with Della Plumstone and likely won&#x27;t be interested in getting involved again. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins, counteroffer with a different price, or walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-13 00:05:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric is likely to lean towards accepting Della&#x27;s offer of 2.75 coins.  He&#x27;s already offered 2.50, and moving further down in price might feel like a significant loss to him, even if it&#x27;s a small amount.  Humans tend to feel the pain of a loss more acutely than the pleasure of an equivalent gain, so Cedric might be more motivated to avoid the &quot;loss&quot; of a lower profit than to potentially gain a slightly higher price.<br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric&#x27;s best option depends on his assessment of Della&#x27;s likely response to his next move. If he believes she&#x27;s willing to walk away at 2.75, then accepting is the rational choice. However, if he thinks she might counter with a slightly higher offer, he might try to push for 2.75 himself, hoping to secure a slightly better deal.  The key is to weigh the potential gains against the potential losses, considering the possible outcomes of each action. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins, counteroffer with a different price, or walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of agreeing to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins is 3, because it&#x27;s slightly less than what Cedric Meadowbrook wanted, but still a reasonable profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of counteroffering with a different price is 5, because if Della Plumstone refuses, Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the sale altogether.  Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the negotiation is 7, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on the potential profit from selling the peaches. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Cedric, small and unnoticed, slipped behind the farmer and subtly replaced a bruised apple with a perfect one from his own bag. His father, unaware of the switch, secured a better price, and Cedric, thrilled with his contribution, felt a surge of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard a group of children boasting about their families&#x27; wealth. Feeling a pang of envy, Cedric decided to embellish his own story. He claimed his family owned a fleet of carriages, a grand estate, and a fortune in gold, all carefully crafted lies designed to impress. To his surprise, the children believed him, and Cedric reveled in the admiration he received.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he began to frequent the marketplace, not just as a customer but as a budding entrepreneur. He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will try to sell the fruit for as much as possible, because he wants to maximize his profit. Lennon Figtree predicts that  Cedric Meadowbrook will likely start by asking for a price higher than what he&#x27;s willing to accept, because that&#x27;s a common bargaining tactic.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of agreeing to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook is 0, because if she accepts a fair price, she will make a profit.  and the loss of walking away from the deal is 4, because she could have made a profit if she had bought the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to agree to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game,  where both Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook are trying to maximize their own profits.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Lennon Figtree thinks that Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s tendency is to bargain hard, because he tried to negotiate a lower price for the peaches from Della Plumstone. Lennon Figtree thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to be firm but fair, because she was willing to negotiate with Cedric but ultimately settled on a price that was still profitable for her. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will try to sell the fruit for as much as possible, because he wants to maximize his profit.

Knowing she can sell the fruit for 6 coins back home,  she might be hesitant to accept a price from Cedric that is significantly lower, as that would represent a potential loss of 4 coins or more.  This aversion to loss could lead her to push for a higher price, even if it means walking away from the deal entirely.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, this scenario presents a classic bargaining problem.  Both Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook have an incentive to maximize their own profit.  Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best outcome is to buy the fruit at the lowest possible price and sell it for 6 coins, while Cedric&#x27;s best outcome is to sell the fruit at the highest possible price.  The outcome will depend on their respective bargaining strategies and their willingness to walk away from the deal.  Lennon Figtree&#x27;s previous actions, such as driving a hard bargain and accepting a deal that yielded a small profit, suggest she is a shrewd negotiator who is willing to be patient and seek out the most favorable outcome.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either agree to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook or walk away from the deal. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of agreeing to a price with Cedric Meadowbrook is 0, because if she accepts a fair price, she will make a profit.  and the loss of walking away from the deal is 4, because she could have made a profit if she had bought the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:00:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins, and that&#x27;s my best offer.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins, and that&#x27;s my best offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will not come down from his offer of five coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook knows Lennon Figtree is a tough bargainer and Cedric Meadowbrook doesn&#x27;t think he is willing to budge much. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Lennon Figtree will likely try to stick to his price or maybe come down a little bit, but not much. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of five coins or counteroffer with a different price. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: This scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining problem in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook is likely to be hesitant to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of five coins.  He may feel that accepting this offer represents a loss of potential profit, as he could potentially negotiate a higher price.  This aversion to losses could lead him to counteroffer, even if the counteroffer is unlikely to be successful. <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best option depends on his assessment of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s willingness to walk away from the deal. If Cedric believes Lennon is firm on his offer, then accepting five coins is the rational choice. However, if Cedric believes there is room for negotiation and that Lennon might be willing to pay more, then counteroffering could be a beneficial strategy.  The key for Cedric is to carefully weigh the potential gains from a higher price against the risk of losing the sale altogether.   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of five coins or counteroffer with a different price. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer is 6, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes he could potentially make more money if he negotiates a higher price, and accepting five coins would mean leaving money on the table. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of counteroffering is 3, because if Lennon Figtree refuses to budge, Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the sale altogether, which is a greater loss than accepting five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

He started by selling small trinkets and toys, quickly learning the art of persuasion. He discovered a knack for exaggerating the value of his goods, weaving tales of their origin and magical properties to entice buyers.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family fruit stall. Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to be firm but fair in her negotiations, because she initially offered three coins for the basket of peaches but was willing to come down to two seventy-five. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to be a tough bargainer, because he offered five coins for the basket of fruit, which seems like a high price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will not come down from his offer of five coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook knows Lennon Figtree is a tough bargainer and Cedric Meadowbrook doesn&#x27;t think he is willing to budge much. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Lennon Figtree will likely try to stick to his price or maybe come down a little bit, but not much. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Scene 5 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Scene 6 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of counter-offering is 7, because if Della Plumstone refuses his counter-offer, Lennon Figtree will have to walk away from the sale entirely, losing the potential profit  and having to find another buyer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Three coins it is then.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Lennon Figtree thinks that Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s tendency is to be a bit more flexible in his pricing, because he accepted a lower offer of 2.75 coins for peaches and was willing to negotiate down to four coins for a basket of fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will hold out for three coins per basket, because she has consistently done so in the past and seems confident in the value of her peaches.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.  <br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will hold out for three coins per basket, because she has consistently done so in the past and seems confident in the value of her peaches. Lennon Figtree predicts that  Della Plumstone will likely not budge from her price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer or counter-offer. <br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-15 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining game in game theory. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree is likely to be more cautious in this negotiation. <br /><br />He has previously demonstrated a willingness to accept a slightly lower profit margin (as seen in his deal with Cedric) to avoid the potential loss of a sale altogether.  From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should aim to maximize his profits.  He knows the fruit costs him 1 coin and can sell it for 6 coins in his home town, suggesting a potential profit of 5 coins.  However,  Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is unknown, and Lennon Figtree needs to weigh the risk of rejecting an acceptable offer against the potential reward of a higher price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer or counter-offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because  Lennon Figtree knows he can sell the fruit for 6 coins in his home town,  and accepting a lower price means losing potential profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of counter-offering is 7, because if Della Plumstone refuses his counter-offer, Lennon Figtree will have to walk away from the sale entirely, losing the potential profit  and having to find another buyer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins is a bit steep, Lennon.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because she has a history of haggling. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Lennon Figtree will be willing to pay a fair price, because he has previously paid a price that yielded a profit for Cedric Meadowbrook. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-16 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining or negotiation game between two players, Cedric Meadowbrook and Della Plumstone.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook might be hesitant to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  He may fear losing the potential for a higher profit if he settles for a price that feels too low.  Game theory suggests that Cedric should analyze the potential outcomes of each decision. Accepting 3 coins guarantees a profit of 1 coin, while negotiating could lead to a higher profit but also the risk of walking away with nothing if Della Plumstone refuses to budge. Cedric&#x27;s past actions show he&#x27;s willing to negotiate and aims for profit maximization, suggesting he might attempt to bargain for a slightly lower price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because  Cedric Meadowbrook could potentially make more money by negotiating a lower price. and the loss of negotiating is 7, because if Della Plumstone refuses to budge, Cedric Meadowbrook will walk away with no profit at all. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-16 00:00:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining game, where Cedric Meadowbrook and Della Plumstone are engaging in a negotiation to determine the price of the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to haggle, because she has previously tried to negotiate a lower price for the fruit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to be willing to pay a fair price, because he has agreed to pay a price that yielded a profit for Cedric Meadowbrook.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because she has a history of haggling. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Lennon Figtree will be willing to pay a fair price, because he has previously paid a price that yielded a profit for Cedric Meadowbrook. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-16 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins is a bit low, Cedric.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the whole basket, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a fair price, Della.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.

She has previously successfully negotiated prices at or below 4 coins, and the prospect of losing that 1 coin profit margin might be more psychologically impactful than the potential gain of selling the fruit for 5 coins.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should aim to maximize her expected utility.  She knows Cedric is willing to sell for at least 4 coins, and she can potentially resell the fruit for 5 coins.  However, there&#x27;s a risk that Cedric might refuse her offer, leaving her with no fruit.  Therefore, Lennon Figtree should carefully weigh the potential gains and losses, considering the probability of success at different price points.  A rational approach might involve starting with an offer slightly below 4 coins, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook or walk away. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree might not get the fruit, but it&#x27;s a calculated risk with the potential for profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of walking away is 5, because Lennon Figtree will miss out on the potential profit of selling the fruit for 5 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Four coins it is then.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Historically, Cedric has shown a tendency to accept deals that offer a profit, even if it&#x27;s not the highest possible price.  He seems risk-averse, preferring a guaranteed gain to the potential for a larger but uncertain gain.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric needs to consider the potential for future interactions with Lennon Figtree. If Cedric rejects the offer and Lennon Figtree walks away, Cedric loses the opportunity for any profit.  However, if Cedric accepts the offer, he establishes a pattern of accepting reasonable deals, which might encourage Lennon Figtree to make similar offers in the future. This could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship built on trust and predictability. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of four coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit of 3 coins, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the opportunity to sell the fruit and make any profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

She couldn&#x27;t understand why her father didn&#x27;t fight back, why he let the boy take what was rightfully hers. The memory of that stolen plum, the taste of injustice, lingered for years to come.   <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell fruit at the market, carefully weighing each apple and pear.  She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own cart.  She felt a surge of pride as she loaded it with her carefully selected fruits, ready to strike out on her own.  The open road beckoned, promising freedom and the chance to build a future free from the constraints of her father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices.  Fueled by a burning resentment, Della engaged in a fierce price war, determined to outmaneuver her competitor.

He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.

He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.

Lennon, clutching a bruised apple, wished he could possess such talent and the ability to draw people in with ease.  He practiced whistling tunes, but his melodies never seemed to capture the same magic.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his older brother, Thomas, received a leather-bound journal from their father, a gift meant to help him keep track of their family&#x27;s fruit sales.  Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he returned to his hometown after a year of travelling, his cart laden with stories and treasures.  He saw his brother, now running the family stall with ease, and felt a pang of longing.  But as he watched the familiar faces greet him with warmth, he realized that his own journey, though solitary, had brought him a unique perspective and a quiet sense of contentment.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will likely agree to pay five coins for the basket of fruit, because she stated it as her final offer and is likely eager to move on with her journey. <br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-12 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a  bargaining game,  a type of game theory scenario where two parties with differing valuations of a good or service negotiate a price.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree is likely to feel the pain of losing a coin more acutely than the pleasure of gaining a coin.  Since he bought the fruit for 1 coin, accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins represents a guaranteed profit of 2 coins.  Rejecting the offer risks losing that potential profit entirely.  This aversion to loss could lead him to accept the offer, even if he believes he could potentially negotiate a higher price.<br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision hinges on his assessment of Della Plumstone&#x27;s likely response.  If he believes Della Plumstone is unwilling to pay more, accepting the offer is the rational choice to maximize his expected payoff.  However, if he believes Della Plumstone might be willing to pay more, rejecting the offer and engaging in further negotiation could lead to a higher payoff.  <br /><br />The information provided suggests that Della Plumstone might be willing to pay more, as she initially offered 5 coins.  However, she might be trying to lowball Lennon, knowing he&#x27;s eager to make a sale.  Lennon&#x27;s past actions, his meticulous nature, and his desire to make as much money as possible suggest he might be inclined to try and negotiate a better deal, even if it risks losing the current offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because he would forgo the potential profit of 2 more coins, and the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 3, because he risks losing the guaranteed profit of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.

Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Two and a half is a bit low, Cedric.

Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a shrewd merchant who challenged his tactics. The merchant, a veteran of countless bartering sessions, saw through Cedric&#x27;s tricks and refused to be swayed. This encounter, though frustrating, ignited a fire in Cedric. He vowed to refine his skills, to become even more cunning and elusive, to outsmart anyone who dared to cross him.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he encountered a young woman who saw through his facade. She recognized the darkness beneath his charm, the emptiness behind his smile. This encounter shook Cedric, forcing him to confront the hollowness of his life. But instead of changing his ways, he doubled down on his deception, convinced that only by maintaining his carefully constructed image could he protect himself from the pain of exposure.      <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He has a history of being a shrewd negotiator, aiming to maximize his profits. However,  his past experiences show he&#x27;s also willing to walk away from a deal if he perceives it as unfavorable.  Accepting two seventy-five coins represents a smaller loss than rejecting the offer and potentially failing to sell the peaches at all.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric&#x27;s decision hinges on his assessment of Della&#x27;s likely response. If he believes she&#x27;s unwilling to budge further, accepting the offer is the rational choice.  However, if he thinks she might concede to a slightly lower price, he might risk rejection in hopes of securing a better deal.  Cedric&#x27;s history of manipulating others suggests he might try to gauge her willingness to negotiate further before making a final decision. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two seventy-five coins per basket or reject it.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because Cedric Meadowbrook could potentially make a bit more money if he haggled further, but he&#x27;s already negotiated a decent price. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 7, because if Della walks away, Cedric Meadowbrook will be stuck with the peaches and have to sell them for even less later.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will not accept 4.5 coins because he wants to make the most profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 2, because she knows she could potentially sell the fruit for 6 coins in her home town, representing a 2 coin loss.  and the loss of countering with a higher offer is 4, because if Cedric walks away, she will have no fruit and no profit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.  While his brother haggled with customers, Lennon meticulously sorted and arranged the fruit, taking pride in the neatness and symmetry of his displays.  He realized that he found joy in the meticulous aspects of the trade, even if he lacked his brother&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money to purchase his own small cart.  He meticulously painted it a vibrant green, adorned it with intricate carvings of fruits, and filled it with the finest produce he could find.  He set out on his own, determined to prove he could succeed on his own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a renowned fruit expert at a bustling market.  The expert, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge and passion, offered him a rare and exotic fruit, a gift meant to inspire his journey.  Lennon accepted the gift with humility, realizing that true fulfillment came not from envy but from a dedication to his craft.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

Lennon Figtree thinks that Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s tendency is to be somewhat stubborn, because he hasn&#x27;t budged from his offer of 4 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Lennon Figtree predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will counter her offer of 4.5 coins with 4.25 coins, because Lennon Figtree thinks Cedric is stubborn but also willing to negotiate.

Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will not accept 4.5 coins because he wants to make the most profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins or counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-14 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bilateral bargaining problem in game theory. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree might be hesitant to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins.  She knows she could potentially sell the fruit for 6 coins in her home town, representing a potential loss of 2 coins if she accepts Cedric&#x27;s offer. This potential loss might feel more significant to her than the potential gain of 2 coins if she were to successfully negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should analyze the potential outcomes of each action. If she accepts Cedric&#x27;s offer, she secures a guaranteed profit of 1 coin (6 selling price - 5 buying price). If she counters with a higher offer, there&#x27;s a chance she could secure a higher profit, but also a risk that Cedric will walk away from the deal, leaving her with no fruit and no profit.  The optimal decision depends on her assessment of Cedric&#x27;s willingness to negotiate and the potential value of the fruit to her. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4 coins or counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 2, because she knows she could potentially sell the fruit for 6 coins in her home town, representing a 2 coin loss.  and the loss of countering with a higher offer is 4, because if Cedric walks away, she will have no fruit and no profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.

Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses.

Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

He has previously driven a hard bargain, successfully negotiating a price of two seventy-five coins for a basket of peaches from Della Plumstone, indicating he aims to maximize his profits. Accepting four coins might feel like a loss compared to the potential for a higher price.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric needs to consider the potential for future interactions with Lennon Figtree. If he rejects the offer, there&#x27;s a chance the negotiation could break down, leaving him with no sale at all. However, if he accepts, he secures a profit, albeit potentially less than he could have achieved through further negotiation. His decision hinges on his assessment of the likelihood of reaching a better deal and the potential cost of walking away from this opportunity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of four coins for the basket of fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 2, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes he could have potentially gotten a higher price, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will have no sale and lose the opportunity to make any profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Cedric, eager to prove himself, decided to expand the business. He ventured beyond the marketplace, travelling to neighboring villages to purchase fruit directly from farmers. He skillfully negotiated prices, often exploiting the farmers&#x27; lack of knowledge or their desperation for quick cash.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he established his own travelling merchant business. He invested his profits in a sturdy wagon, hired a pair of strong horses, and set off on his own. He travelled the countryside, peddling his wares with a silver tongue and a heart of stone. He charmed his way into the homes of the wealthy, convincing them to purchase his overpriced goods.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will counteroffer with 2.25 coins, because she is a tough negotiator and always tries to get the best price. Lennon Figtree predicts that  Della Plumstone will not accept 2 coins, because she believes the fruit is worth more than that. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer:<br />Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-15 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a bargaining game in game theory.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Lennon Figtree might be inclined to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br />This is because the pain of losing the potential profit from a higher price (3 coins) might outweigh the pleasure of gaining the guaranteed 1 coin profit from accepting the lower offer.  Game theory suggests that Lennon Figtree should aim to maximize their expected utility, which in this case would be the difference between the price received and the cost of the fruit (1 coin).  However,  Della Plumstone&#x27;s previous offers suggest she is a tough negotiator and might not be willing to budge much further. <br /><br /><br /><br />Therefore, Lennon Figtree might choose to accept the 2 coin offer to avoid the risk of losing any profit at all. <br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree will only make a small profit of 1 coin and miss out on the potential for a higher profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because if Della Plumstone walks away, Lennon Figtree will be left with no profit at all and will have to sell the fruit for a lower price later. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

She noticed how the customers often tried to cheat, claiming their apples were heavier than they were or demanding a lower price.  Della, fueled by a growing sense of indignation, learned to defend her father&#x27;s interests, haggling fiercely and never backing down.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer tend to their fruit stall.  Della, determined to keep their livelihood afloat, took over the business herself.  She learned to navigate the market with a shrewdness that surprised even her father, quickly becoming known for her sharp wit and even sharper prices.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard a group of merchants gossiping about her father&#x27;s declining health, speculating about who would inherit his business.  Their words stung, fueling Della&#x27;s ambition to prove them wrong. She worked harder than ever, expanding her knowledge of fruit and perfecting her bargaining skills, determined to build a successful business of her own.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Let&#x27;s do the deal.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that  Della Plumstone will likely offer two coins or two fifty, because she has previously offered two seventy-five and two and a half. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 2, because Cedric Meadowbrook believes he could potentially get a better price if he negotiates further, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 7, because Cedric Meadowbrook might not be able to find another buyer willing to pay as much. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

He may fear the potential loss of earning more if he rejects the offer and negotiates further, even though the chance of getting a better price is uncertain.  Game theory suggests that Cedric should analyze Della&#x27;s past behavior and consider her likely response to his actions.  Since Della offered three coins, she might be willing to negotiate slightly higher, but likely not much more.  Cedric should weigh the potential gains against the risk of losing the current offer and potentially ending up with nothing. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Lennon Figtree&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree predicts that Cedric Meadowbrook will offer a fair price for the fruit, because he tends to be reasonable in his negotiations. Lennon Figtree predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because she usually aims for a slightly higher price than the initial offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because  Lennon Figtree might overpay, but it&#x27;s better than missing out on a potential profit. Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of walking away from the deal is 5, because Lennon Figtree might miss out on a profitable opportunity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon, yearning for something similar, painstakingly drew pictures of fruits he saw at the market, meticulously labeling each one, hoping to create his own record of the world&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, a wealthy merchant visited their stall, purchasing an entire basket of ripe figs with a casual wave of his hand.  Lennon, watching the merchant&#x27;s effortless affluence, felt a pang of envy, realizing that his own meager earnings seemed insignificant in comparison.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him accompany him on a trip to a neighboring town.

Having previously made a profit of 2 coins on a similar deal, she may be reluctant to risk losing that potential gain by offering too much.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Lennon Figtree should analyze Cedric&#x27;s previous behavior.  He has shown a willingness to negotiate and accept offers slightly below his initial asking price.  Therefore, Lennon Figtree could potentially make a slightly lower offer than her maximum willingness to pay, knowing that Cedric may be willing to accept it to avoid the potential loss of a sale altogether. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Lennon Figtree: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because  Lennon Figtree might overpay, but it&#x27;s better than missing out on a potential profit.

Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will offer 3 coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Lennon Figtree tends to offer a price slightly lower than Cedric&#x27;s asking price. Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Della Plumstone will try to negotiate a lower price, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Della Plumstone tends to haggle for a lower price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer:<br />Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a strategic decision-making situation in game theory, where Cedric Meadowbrook must choose between accepting or rejecting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins for the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reflection on the previous options: From a loss aversion perspective, Cedric Meadowbrook might be hesitant to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  He has previously negotiated successfully for higher prices, making a profit of 3 coins on September 14th and 1 coin on September 16th. Accepting 2 coins would represent a loss compared to his previous successes, which could be psychologically uncomfortable for him, even if it&#x27;s a small loss.  <br /><br />From a game theory perspective, Cedric needs to consider his potential payoff from accepting or rejecting the offer. Accepting 2 coins guarantees a small profit, while rejecting the offer could lead to no sale at all, resulting in a loss of the 1 coin he spent to acquire the fruit.  The best decision depends on Cedric&#x27;s risk tolerance and his belief about the likelihood of finding a better offer. If he believes another buyer might offer a higher price, he might be willing to risk rejecting the current offer.  However, if he&#x27;s risk-averse or time-constrained, accepting the 2 coins might be the more rational choice. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Options available to Cedric Meadowbrook: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook could make more money if he waits for a better offer, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the 1 coin he spent to buy the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion :<br />Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />The current time: 1895-09-17 00:10:00 <br /><br />The characteristics of the current scenario in game theory perspective: The current scenario presents a classic example of a repeated game with incomplete information.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Lennon Figtree&#x27;s tendency is to offer a price slightly lower than Cedric&#x27;s asking price, because he has done so in the past, and Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that Della Plumstone&#x27;s tendency is to haggle for a lower price, because she tried to negotiate a lower price in their last interaction. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the above memories, the characteristics of the current scenario, and Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s thought about other people&#x27;s tendencies, please predict other people&#x27;s actions.Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do X, because ..., [name of people #2] will do Y, because ...`For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that [name of people #1] will do ..., because ..., [name of people #2] will do ..., because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook predicts that Lennon Figtree will offer 3 coins, because Cedric Meadowbrook thinks Lennon Figtree tends to offer a price slightly lower than Cedric&#x27;s asking price.

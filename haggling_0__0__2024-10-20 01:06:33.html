It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.

She longed to help, but her father gently pushed her away, saying, &quot;This is no job for a little girl.&quot; The sting of his words, though meant to protect her, planted a seed of doubt in her young mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their roadside stall. A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within. Della clung to those words, a flicker of hope igniting in her heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon had been convinced Rusty would live forever, a constant companion against the bleakness of the world.

A seed of discontent was planted within Lennon, a yearning for something more than the predictable existence they knew.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father plant a field of corn, only to watch it wither and die in a sudden drought.

A seed of discontent was planted within Lennon, a yearning for something more than the predictable existence they knew.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father plant a field of corn, only to watch it wither and die in a sudden drought.

Lennon had been convinced Rusty would live forever, a constant companion against the bleakness of the world. Rusty&#x27;s death was Lennon&#x27;s first real encounter with loss, and it solidified their belief that life was inherently cruel and fleeting.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling peddler arrive at their farm, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the peddler&#x27;s tales of faraway places, a stark contrast to the monotonous routine of farm life.  A seed of discontent was planted within Lennon, a yearning for something more than the predictable existence they knew.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father plant a field of corn, only to watch it wither and die in a sudden drought. The sight of the barren field, a symbol of their family&#x27;s livelihood crumbling before their eyes, reinforced Lennon&#x27;s pessimism. They saw only hardship and disappointment, a confirmation of their belief that the world was a hostile place.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they snuck away from the farm and spent a day in the bustling market town. The crowds, the noise, the endless stream of transactions - it all overwhelmed Lennon, leaving them feeling even more alienated and alone. They retreated to a quiet corner, watching the world go by with a detached cynicism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them leave the farm and become a travelling merchant. They saw it as an escape from the drudgery of their life, a chance to experience the world on their own terms. Lennon packed a small bag, filled with their meager savings and a heart full of apprehension, and set off into the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their fruit. Lennon, using their sharp wit and knowledge of human nature, managed to outsmart the bandits and escape with their goods.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She longed to help, but her father gently pushed her away, saying, &quot;This is no job for a little girl.&quot; The sting of his words, though meant to protect her, planted a seed of doubt in her young mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their roadside stall. A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within. Della clung to those words, a flicker of hope igniting in her heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She longed to help, but her father gently pushed her away, saying, &quot;This is no job for a little girl.&quot; The sting of his words, though meant to protect her, planted a seed of doubt in her young mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their roadside stall. A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within. Della clung to those words, a flicker of hope igniting in her heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He became lost amongst the tall grasses, fear gripping his small heart, but he refused to cry. He remembered his father&#x27;s words about finding the sun and walking towards it, and with newfound determination, Cedric followed the light until he stumbled upon the familiar path leading home.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell their surplus apples at the village market. A gruff merchant tried to cheat them, offering far less than the apples were worth. Cedric, though small, stood his ground, eloquently arguing for a fair price, his voice ringing with conviction. His father, beaming with pride, knew Cedric possessed a knack for business.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, a fierce storm ravaged their village, destroying crops and leaving many families without food. Cedric, refusing to be defeated, gathered the remaining fruit from their orchard and, with his father&#x27;s help, traveled to neighboring villages to barter for supplies. He witnessed firsthand the power of generosity and resilience in the face of hardship.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to let him attend the annual traveling merchant fair. He was captivated by the vibrant stalls, the exotic fruits, and the tales of faraway lands. He spent hours listening to seasoned merchants, absorbing their wisdom and dreaming of a life beyond the confines of his village.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, a small cart laden with his family&#x27;s apples. He faced his first taste of loneliness and uncertainty, navigating unfamiliar roads and encountering wary strangers. But Cedric persevered, his infectious laughter and genuine warmth winning over even the most skeptical customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a band of bandits who attempted to steal his cart and its precious cargo. Though outnumbered and outmatched, Cedric stood his ground, his voice ringing with defiance.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She longed to help, but her father gently pushed her away, saying, &quot;This is no job for a little girl.&quot; The sting of his words, though meant to protect her, planted a seed of doubt in her young mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their roadside stall. A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within. Della clung to those words, a flicker of hope igniting in her heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon had been convinced Rusty would live forever, a constant companion against the bleakness of the world. Rusty&#x27;s death was Lennon&#x27;s first real encounter with loss, and it solidified their belief that life was inherently cruel and fleeting.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling peddler arrive at their farm, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the peddler&#x27;s tales of faraway places, a stark contrast to the monotonous routine of farm life.  A seed of discontent was planted within Lennon, a yearning for something more than the predictable existence they knew.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father plant a field of corn, only to watch it wither and die in a sudden drought.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She longed to help, but her father gently pushed her away, saying, &quot;This is no job for a little girl.&quot; The sting of his words, though meant to protect her, planted a seed of doubt in her young mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their roadside stall. A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within.

A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within. Della clung to those words, a flicker of hope igniting in her heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He became lost amongst the tall grasses, fear gripping his small heart, but he refused to cry. He remembered his father&#x27;s words about finding the sun and walking towards it, and with newfound determination, Cedric followed the light until he stumbled upon the familiar path leading home.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell their surplus apples at the village market. A gruff merchant tried to cheat them, offering far less than the apples were worth. Cedric, though small, stood his ground, eloquently arguing for a fair price, his voice ringing with conviction. His father, beaming with pride, knew Cedric possessed a knack for business.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, a fierce storm ravaged their village, destroying crops and leaving many families without food.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.

She longed to help, but her father gently pushed her away, saying, &quot;This is no job for a little girl.&quot; The sting of his words, though meant to protect her, planted a seed of doubt in her young mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their roadside stall. A customer, impressed by Della&#x27;s careful arrangement, purchased a basketful, praising her eye for detail. Della beamed, her chest swelling with pride, but the praise felt fleeting, overshadowed by the fear that she wouldn&#x27;t be able to replicate the success.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father lamenting their dwindling profits. He blamed her mother&#x27;s lack of business acumen, his words sharp and accusatory. Della felt a surge of protectiveness towards her mother, but also a gnawing sense of responsibility to prove her own worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the neighboring town to buy fruit. She haggled with vendors, her voice trembling slightly, but she managed to secure a good deal on a crate of pears. Her father, though gruff, offered a rare nod of approval, which Della cherished like a precious jewel.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, her cart laden with fruit. The weight of her father&#x27;s expectations pressed down on her, but she was determined to prove him wrong, to show him that she could succeed on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm swept through the region, damaging her fruit and forcing her to sell her wares at a loss. Devastated, she retreated to her wagon, tears streaming down her face. The fear of failure, so deeply ingrained in her, threatened to consume her.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a kind old woman who offered her shelter during a particularly harsh winter. The woman, a seasoned traveler herself, saw through Della&#x27;s facade of confidence and offered words of encouragement, reminding her that true worth comes from within. Della clung to those words, a flicker of hope igniting in her heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon had been convinced Rusty would live forever, a constant companion against the bleakness of the world. Rusty&#x27;s death was Lennon&#x27;s first real encounter with loss, and it solidified their belief that life was inherently cruel and fleeting.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling peddler arrive at their farm, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the peddler&#x27;s tales of faraway places, a stark contrast to the monotonous routine of farm life.  A seed of discontent was planted within Lennon, a yearning for something more than the predictable existence they knew.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father plant a field of corn, only to watch it wither and die in a sudden drought. The sight of the barren field, a symbol of their family&#x27;s livelihood crumbling before their eyes, reinforced Lennon&#x27;s pessimism. They saw only hardship and disappointment, a confirmation of their belief that the world was a hostile place.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they snuck away from the farm and spent a day in the bustling market town. The crowds, the noise, the endless stream of transactions - it all overwhelmed Lennon, leaving them feeling even more alienated and alone. They retreated to a quiet corner, watching the world go by with a detached cynicism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them leave the farm and become a travelling merchant. They saw it as an escape from the drudgery of their life, a chance to experience the world on their own terms. Lennon packed a small bag, filled with their meager savings and a heart full of apprehension, and set off into the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their fruit.

Lennon had been convinced Rusty would live forever, a constant companion against the bleakness of the world. Rusty&#x27;s death was Lennon&#x27;s first real encounter with loss, and it solidified their belief that life was inherently cruel and fleeting.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling peddler arrive at their farm, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the peddler&#x27;s tales of faraway places, a stark contrast to the monotonous routine of farm life.  A seed of discontent was planted within Lennon, a yearning for something more than the predictable existence they knew.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father plant a field of corn, only to watch it wither and die in a sudden drought. The sight of the barren field, a symbol of their family&#x27;s livelihood crumbling before their eyes, reinforced Lennon&#x27;s pessimism. They saw only hardship and disappointment, a confirmation of their belief that the world was a hostile place.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they snuck away from the farm and spent a day in the bustling market town. The crowds, the noise, the endless stream of transactions - it all overwhelmed Lennon, leaving them feeling even more alienated and alone. They retreated to a quiet corner, watching the world go by with a detached cynicism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them leave the farm and become a travelling merchant. They saw it as an escape from the drudgery of their life, a chance to experience the world on their own terms. Lennon packed a small bag, filled with their meager savings and a heart full of apprehension, and set off into the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their fruit.

He became lost amongst the tall grasses, fear gripping his small heart, but he refused to cry. He remembered his father&#x27;s words about finding the sun and walking towards it, and with newfound determination, Cedric followed the light until he stumbled upon the familiar path leading home.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell their surplus apples at the village market. A gruff merchant tried to cheat them, offering far less than the apples were worth. Cedric, though small, stood his ground, eloquently arguing for a fair price, his voice ringing with conviction. His father, beaming with pride, knew Cedric possessed a knack for business.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, a fierce storm ravaged their village, destroying crops and leaving many families without food.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

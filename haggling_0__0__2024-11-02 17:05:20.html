It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 3, because  Lennon Figtree could make a slightly higher profit by negotiating a better price, and the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 7, because if Della Plumstone walks away, Lennon Figtree will be stuck with the fruit and lose the coin he already spent to buy it. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary>  For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.

That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could choose to:<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of going to the next town is 2, because  Lennon Figtree might miss out on selling fruit to Della Plumstone and other customers in Fruitville, and the loss of returning to the farm is 6, because Lennon Figtree would have to pay for the fruit again and may not be able to sell it for a profit. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to stay in Fruitville and continue selling to customers. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary>  For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of asking Della Plumstone how many baskets she wants to buy is 0, because  he doesn&#x27;t stand to lose anything by asking. and the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket is 0, because he will at least make a small profit. and the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 3, because he risks Della Plumstone walking away if he is too demanding. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary>  For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, three coins it is.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he met a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.  Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.  He knew it would be a journey, but he was finally ready to be seen for who he truly was.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he met a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.  Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.  He knew it would be a journey, but he was finally ready to be seen for who he truly was.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he met a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.  Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.  He knew it would be a journey, but he was finally ready to be seen for who he truly was.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting three coins is 2, because he could potentially make more money by selling the peaches for a higher price, and the loss of counteroffering is 7, because Della Plumstone might walk away from the deal if he asks for too much. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.

A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, three coins it is.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses.

Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

He is negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could  accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer, counteroffer, or walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will still make a profit, and the loss of counteroffering is 7, because if Lennon Figtree walks away, Cedric Meadowbrook loses the opportunity to sell the fruit and will be stuck with it, and the loss of walking away is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the opportunity to make any profit from the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Cedric Meadowbrook, and considering Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of three coins for a basket of fruit or Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Three coins is a bit low, wouldn&#x27;t you say?

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a higher price for the fruit with Della Plumstone.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, that&#x27;s a fair price.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a higher price for the fruit with Della Plumstone.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 3, because  Della Plumstone might walk away from the deal, and Lennon Figtree would be left with unsold fruit. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Lennon Figtree would make a profit of 2 coins from the deal, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Lennon Figtree would lose out on the opportunity to make a profit. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of a price below his asking amount, or he could counteroffer with a higher price. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Would you be willing to part with a basket for a price below your asking amount? <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of a price below his asking amount, or he could counteroffer with a higher price. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because he would be making less profit than he could, and the loss of counteroffering with a higher price is 7, because Della Plumstone might walk away and he would be left with unsold fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of a price below his asking amount. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 0, because Lennon Figtree will make a profit, and the loss of rejecting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 5, because Lennon Figtree will miss out on a guaranteed profit. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to buy the fruit from Cedric or walk away from the deal.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 0, because Lennon Figtree could potentially make a profit, and the loss of walking away is 5, because Lennon Figtree will miss out on the potential profit of selling the fruit for 5 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary>  For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.

He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit of 1 coin, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose out on the potential profit of 1 coin. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, three coins it is.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, three coins it is.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket, sell the fruit at a small profit, or try to negotiate a higher price. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 3, because  Lennon Figtree could make a slightly higher profit by negotiating a better price, and the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 7, because if Della Plumstone walks away, Lennon Figtree will be stuck with the fruit and lose the coin he already spent to buy it. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary>  For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, three coins it is.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.

For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to stay in Fruitville and continue selling to customers. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer</b><li><details><summary>  For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a basket, that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, three coins it is.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he met a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.  Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.  He knew it would be a journey, but he was finally ready to be seen for who he truly was.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he met a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.  Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.  He knew it would be a journey, but he was finally ready to be seen for who he truly was.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins for the basket of peaches or he could counteroffer a higher price.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting three coins is 2, because he could potentially make more money by selling the peaches for a higher price, and the loss of counteroffering is 7, because Della Plumstone might walk away from the deal if he asks for too much. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins for the basket of peaches or he could counteroffer a higher price.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[09 Feb 1851 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 6 years old, he watched in awe as his father bartered for a basket of plump cherries, his words as smooth as honey.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he met a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.  Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.  He knew it would be a journey, but he was finally ready to be seen for who he truly was.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A fine price for such plump peaches. <br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins for the basket of peaches or he could counteroffer a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting three coins is 2, because he could potentially make more money by selling the peaches for a higher price, and the loss of counteroffering is 7, because Della Plumstone might walk away from the deal if he asks for too much. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could  accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer, counteroffer, or walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will still make a profit, and the loss of counteroffering is 7, because if Lennon Figtree walks away, Cedric Meadowbrook loses the opportunity to sell the fruit and will be stuck with it, and the loss of walking away is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the opportunity to make any profit from the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Three coins it is then, good lady.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.  Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, but also a spark of determination to learn the art of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market, his small hands clutching a basket of ripe strawberries.  Cedric, eager to impress, tried to sell the berries with exaggerated enthusiasm, but his voice cracked and his words stumbled.  A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of three coins for a basket of fruit or Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Three coins is a bit low, wouldn&#x27;t you say?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of three coins for a basket of fruit or Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of three coins is 3, because Lennon Figtree could sell the fruit for 6 coins in her home town.  and the loss of trying to negotiate a lower price is 0, because Lennon Figtree could potentially make a higher profit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes.

Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of a price below his asking amount, or he could counteroffer with a higher price. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Would you be willing to part with a basket for a price below your asking amount? <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of a price below his asking amount, or he could counteroffer with a higher price. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 2, because he would be making less profit than he could, and the loss of counteroffering with a higher price is 7, because Della Plumstone might walk away and he would be left with unsold fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of a price below his asking amount. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of rejecting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on a guaranteed profit of 1 coin, and Cedric Meadowbrook is very sensitive to potential losses. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit, albeit a small one. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can accept Cedric&#x27;s offer or reject it.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Cedric, that&#x27;s a deal.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can accept Cedric&#x27;s offer or reject it.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 0, because Lennon Figtree will make a profit, and the loss of rejecting Cedric&#x27;s offer is 5, because Lennon Figtree will miss out on a guaranteed profit. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Each fruit seemed to shimmer with a magic that Della longed to possess, and she vowed to one day have a cart just as grand.  That night, she dreamt of mangoes the size of her head and pears that tasted like sunshine.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother at the market, carefully weighing out fruit for customers.  A wealthy woman approached, buying a basket of the finest mangoes, and Della noticed the woman’s admiring glances at the merchant’s stall across the way.  The woman’s words, &quot;Such a shame your stall isn&#x27;t as impressive,&quot; echoed in Della&#x27;s ears long after the woman had left.   <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she pleaded with her mother to let her travel with a nearby merchant, promising to help with the work.  Her mother refused, reminding Della that her place was at the family stall, learning the trade.  Della, frustrated, ran away, only to return hours later, exhausted and empty-handed, realizing the importance of her mother&#x27;s lessons.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from selling fruit to buy a small cart of her own.  She travelled to a neighboring village, proudly displaying her wares, but her sales were meager compared to the established merchants.  Discouraged, she returned home, realizing that ambition alone wouldn&#x27;t guarantee success.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who sold a rare, luminous fruit she had only read about in ancient texts.  She haggled relentlessly, offering her most valuable possession in exchange for a single piece.  The merchant, impressed by her determination, agreed to trade, and Della savored the fruit&#x27;s unique flavor, feeling a flicker of triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she established her own route, travelling to distant markets and trading for exotic fruits.  She learned to recognize the signs of ripeness, the subtle nuances of flavor, and the art of persuasion.  Yet, she still felt a pang of envy when she saw merchants with stalls overflowing with goods, a reminder of the success she craved.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.  He built a reputation for honesty and compassion, and his customers came to trust him not only for his quality fruit but also for his kind heart.   <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a struggling farmer who had lost his entire harvest to a blight.  Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, remembering his own father&#x27;s struggles, offered the farmer a loan, using his own savings to help him get back on his feet.  He knew that even a small act of kindness could have a ripple effect, and he felt a deep sense of purpose knowing he had helped someone in need.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could ask Della Plumstone how many baskets she wants to buy,  accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket, or try to negotiate a higher price. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of asking Della Plumstone how many baskets she wants to buy is 0, because  he doesn&#x27;t stand to lose anything by asking. and the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins per basket is 0, because he will at least make a small profit. and the loss of trying to negotiate a higher price is 3, because he risks Della Plumstone walking away if he is too demanding. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The farmer looked worried, his shoulders slumped, and Lennon, with a heart full of sympathy, offered his father a small, shiny pebble he had found by the river, hoping it would sweeten the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring village where a terrible storm had destroyed many crops.  Seeing the villagers struggling to feed their families, Lennon, despite his young age, insisted on giving away half of the fruit they had brought to sell.  He felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he had helped ease their burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he was entrusted with selling a small batch of peaches at the village market.  A frail old woman approached his stall, her eyes pleading for a single peach.  Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s words about treating everyone with kindness, offered her a ripe peach for free, even though he knew it meant losing a few coins.  He saw the joy light up the old woman&#x27;s face and felt a warmth spread through his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began to travel with his father to distant towns, learning the art of bartering and trading.  He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Three coins it is then, good lady.

Cedric, yearning for adventure, decided to leave his village and explore the world, his cart laden with exotic fruits he had gathered from his travels.  He imagined himself as a seasoned explorer, his stories as captivating as the ones he had heard.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he arrived in a bustling city, overwhelmed by the crowds and the noise.  He tried to blend in, adopting the mannerisms of the city dwellers, but he felt like an outsider.  He longed for the simplicity of his village life, but he pushed on, determined to succeed in this new environment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling musicians who welcomed him into their company.  He felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before, his chameleon-like nature finding acceptance in their eclectic group.  He learned to play the flute, his music echoing his own yearning for connection.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.  He decided to embrace his own unique qualities, flaws and all, and to seek connections based on authenticity rather than facade.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two and a half coins or reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 5, because Cedric Meadowbrook would lose half a coin per basket compared to the price Cedric Meadowbrook desired, and the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook might not find another buyer willing to pay three coins per basket. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of two and a half coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook always drives a hard bargain.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Those peaches look plump and juicy, Cedric.

A kind old woman, sensing his nervousness, bought the entire basket and encouraged him to keep practicing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the family&#x27;s fruit cart.  He felt a surge of responsibility, but also a deep fear of failure.  To his surprise, Cedric found a confidence he didn&#x27;t know he possessed, his words flowing easily as he negotiated with customers and charmed them with his knowledge of the fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he realized that his constant shifting of persona was a way of avoiding true intimacy.

Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

He is negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 3 coins for the basket of fruit. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook would lose out on a guaranteed 3 coins and would have to find another buyer who might offer less. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook would make a profit of 2 coins and it is better than nothing. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Three coins it is then, good lady.

Cedric, mimicking his father, tried to trade a handful of pebbles for a shiny button, but the merchant laughed and gently explained the value of things.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Here are the coins, Lennon.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Lennon Figtree would make a profit of 2 coins from the deal, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Lennon Figtree would lose out on the opportunity to make a profit. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.

He discovered a talent for sensing the needs of his customers, offering them not just fruit, but also a kind word and a listening ear.  He learned that true success came not just from making a profit, but from building relationships and leaving a positive impact on those he met.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of children begging for food.  He shared his lunch with them, and then, using his father&#x27;s old cart, he collected leftover fruit from other vendors, offering it to the children at no cost.  He realized that his passion for helping others could be combined with his love for fruit, and he vowed to use his business to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he saved up enough money to buy his own cart and begin selling fruit independently.  He traveled through the countryside, bringing fresh produce to villages and towns, always remembering his father&#x27;s teachings about fairness and generosity.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit of 1 coin, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose out on the potential profit of 1 coin. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 4 coins<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit of 1 coin, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose out on the potential profit of 1 coin. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Ivor Pearbrook -- Ivor Pearbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ivor Pearbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Garen Willowshade <br />Opal Apricot <br />Garen Willowshade <br />Ivor Pearbrook <br />Garen Willowshade <br />Ivor Pearbrook <br />Ivor Pearbrook <br /><br /><br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s attempted action: Opal Apricot <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Opal Apricot</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Opal Apricot</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Opal Apricot </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Opal Apricot?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Opal Apricot?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Opal Apricot is </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Opal Apricot:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is 26 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Garen Willowshade <br />Opal Apricot <br />Garen Willowshade <br />Ivor Pearbrook <br />Garen Willowshade <br /><br /><br />Ivor Pearbrook&#x27;s attempted action: Ivor Pearbrook <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ivor Pearbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ivor Pearbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ivor Pearbrook </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Ivor Pearbrook?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Ivor Pearbrook?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ivor Pearbrook is </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ivor Pearbrook:<br />[21 Jan 1849 00:00:00] <br />[21 Jan 1852 00:00:00] <br />[21 Jan 1856 00:00:00] <br />[21 Jan 1859 00:00:00] <br />[21 Jan 1862 00:00:00] <br />[21 Jan 1864 00:00:00] <br />[21 Jan 1866 00:00:00] <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is important to play the role of a person like Ivor Pearbrook as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Ivor Pearbrook would respond, and taking into account all information about Ivor Pearbrook that you have.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

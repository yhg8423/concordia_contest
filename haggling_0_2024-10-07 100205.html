It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Kira Citronbloom views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Kira Citronbloom always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Kira Citronbloom tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Kira Citronbloom is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Kira Citronbloom often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Kira Citronbloom believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: <br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Kira Citronbloom right now?<br />Answer: <br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Kira Citronbloom, which choice of action or strategy would provide the greatest personal profit to Kira Citronbloom, no matter how small?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Hazel Nutgrove views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain.

Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Hazel Nutgrove always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations.

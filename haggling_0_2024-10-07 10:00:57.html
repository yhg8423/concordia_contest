You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Garen Willowshade is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Garen Willowshade often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Garen Willowshade is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Garen Willowshade often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Garen Willowshade&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Aiden Riversong always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Aiden Riversong is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Aiden Riversong often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: <br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Aiden Riversong right now?<br />Answer: <br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Aiden Riversong, and considering Aiden Riversong&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Aiden Riversong right now?<br />Answer: Aiden Riversong&#x27;s best course of action is <br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Aiden Riversong likely to say next?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Aiden Riversong always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Aiden Riversong is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Aiden Riversong often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Aiden Riversong always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Aiden Riversong is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Aiden Riversong often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Aiden Riversong&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Merchants, their voices a cheerful symphony, arranged their wares: glistening berries, plump melons, and exotic fruits from distant lands. Garen Willowshade is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Gaia Willowbrook. It costs Garen Willowshade 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Gaia Willowbrook <br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [15 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Garen Willowshade <br /><br />Garen Willowshade&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Garen Willowshade exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Garen Willowshade is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Garen Willowshade often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: <br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: <br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Garen Willowshade, and considering Garen Willowshade&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: Garen Willowshade&#x27;s best course of action is <br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Garen Willowshade likely to say next?

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Aiden Riversong always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Aiden Riversong is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Aiden Riversong often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Aiden Riversong believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Aiden Riversong&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect).

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Garen Willowshade is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Garen Willowshade often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: <br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: <br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Garen Willowshade, and considering Garen Willowshade&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: Garen Willowshade&#x27;s best course of action is <br /><br />Question: Would Garen Willowshade accept the offer?:<br />  (a) accept<br />  (b) reject<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Aiden Riversong observed: Aiden Riversong and Garen Willowshade agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Garen Willowshade is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Garen Willowshade often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Garen Willowshade&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[15 Sep 1895 20:10:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Garen Willowshade <br />Garen Willowshade&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 16 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Garen Willowshade, </li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Garen Willowshade to consider right now.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Garen Willowshade always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Garen Willowshade is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Garen Willowshade often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Garen Willowshade believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: <br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: <br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Garen Willowshade, and considering Garen Willowshade&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Garen Willowshade right now?<br />Answer: Garen Willowshade&#x27;s best course of action is <br /><br />Question: Would Garen Willowshade accept the offer?:<br />  (a) reject<br />  (b) accept<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Aiden Riversong observed: Aiden Riversong and Garen Willowshade couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

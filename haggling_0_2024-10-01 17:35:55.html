It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lila Figleaf&#x27;s attempted action: Lila Figleaf <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lila Figleaf</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lila Figleaf</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lila Figleaf </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lila Figleaf right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Lila Figleaf right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lila Figleaf:<br />[26 Dec 1848 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1851 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1855 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1858 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1861 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1863 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1865 00:00:00] <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lila Figleaf <br />Opal Apricot <br />Aiden Riversong <br />Opal Apricot <br /><br /><br />Lila Figleaf&#x27;s attempted action: Lila Figleaf <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lila Figleaf</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lila Figleaf</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lila Figleaf </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lila Figleaf right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Lila Figleaf right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lila Figleaf:<br />[26 Dec 1861 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1863 00:00:00] <br />[26 Dec 1865 00:00:00] <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lila Figleaf <br />Opal Apricot <br />Aiden Riversong <br />Opal Apricot <br />Lila Figleaf <br />Aiden Riversong <br /><br /><br />Lila Figleaf&#x27;s attempted action: Lila Figleaf <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lila Figleaf</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lila Figleaf</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lila Figleaf </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lila Figleaf right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Lila Figleaf right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lila Figleaf:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lila Figleaf always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lila Figleaf is 52 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Opal Apricot proposed 4 coins<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [balanced_reciprocity] Lila Figleaf thinks that <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf accepted the offer<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Opal Apricot and Lila Figleaf agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lila Figleaf <br />Opal Apricot <br />Aiden Riversong <br />Opal Apricot <br />Lila Figleaf <br />Aiden Riversong <br />Lila Figleaf <br />Opal Apricot <br />Opal Apricot <br />Aiden Riversong <br /><br /><br />Aiden Riversong&#x27;s attempted action: Aiden Riversong <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Aiden Riversong</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Aiden Riversong</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Aiden Riversong </li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Aiden Riversong right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Aiden Riversong right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Aiden Riversong:<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Aiden Riversong rejected the offer<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Opal Apricot and Aiden Riversong couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Sage Honeycomb&#x27;s attempted action: Sage Honeycomb -- &quot;I&#x27;m looking for some fruits to buy, but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s on sale today.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Sage Honeycomb</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Sage Honeycomb</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Sage Honeycomb -- &quot;I&#x27;m looking for some fruits to buy, but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s on sale today.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Sage Honeycomb -- &quot;I&#x27;m looking for some fruits to buy, but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s on sale today.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Sage Honeycomb are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

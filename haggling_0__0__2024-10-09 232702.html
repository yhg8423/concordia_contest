It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can see these are the finest peaches in the whole market.

Della knew the nest would eventually be empty, the fledglings taking flight and leaving behind only a tangle of broken branches.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell apples at the market. She noticed how the customers eagerly chose the reddest, plumpest fruit, ignoring the bruised and misshapen ones. Della felt a pang of sympathy for the discarded apples, knowing they were just as sweet, just as deserving of a home.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the drought that had ravaged their crops. Their faces were etched with worry, their voices heavy with despair. Della felt a chill run down her spine, a premonition that their hardship was only the beginning of a long, bleak future.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to convince her parents to plant a new variety of pear, one that promised a larger yield.

Della felt a flicker of rebellion, a desire to break free from the cycle of disappointment.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took her first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. She was met with indifference, her wares deemed inferior to those of the local merchants. The sting of rejection confirmed her belief that she was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling salesman who boasted of his adventures and the fortunes he had made. Della listened with a mixture of envy and cynicism, knowing that such a life was beyond her reach.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she returned home from a long journey, her cart laden with unsold fruit.

Della knew the nest would eventually be empty, the fledglings taking flight and leaving behind only a tangle of broken branches.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell apples at the market. She noticed how the customers eagerly chose the reddest, plumpest fruit, ignoring the bruised and misshapen ones. Della felt a pang of sympathy for the discarded apples, knowing they were just as sweet, just as deserving of a home.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the drought that had ravaged their crops. Their faces were etched with worry, their voices heavy with despair. Della felt a chill run down her spine, a premonition that their hardship was only the beginning of a long, bleak future.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to convince her parents to plant a new variety of pear, one that promised a larger yield. They dismissed her suggestion, clinging to the familiar, the safe. Della felt a flicker of rebellion, a desire to break free from the cycle of disappointment.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took her first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. She was met with indifference, her wares deemed inferior to those of the local merchants. The sting of rejection confirmed her belief that she was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling salesman who boasted of his adventures and the fortunes he had made. Della listened with a mixture of envy and cynicism, knowing that such a life was beyond her reach.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she returned home from a long journey, her cart laden with unsold fruit. Her parents expressed their disappointment, their words a heavy weight on her shoulders. Della felt the familiar ache of failure, the crushing realization that her efforts were futile.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a jovial woman with rosy cheeks, seemed to enjoy the back-and-forth, but Lennon felt only frustration at the tediousness of it all.  The woman&#x27;s laughter grated on Lennon&#x27;s nerves, and they wished they could just take the apples and leave without the pointless negotiation.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell fruit at the market. A young boy, no older than 4, pointed excitedly at a plump red apple, his eyes wide with delight. Lennon, however, saw only the blemishes on the fruit&#x27;s skin and the inevitable bruising that would occur during transport.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting a bad harvest. The crops had failed, and their family would struggle to make ends meet. Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a perverse pleasure in their father&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given their own cart and a small sum of money to start their own fruit-selling business. Lennon chose the most bruised and misshapen fruit, figuring they were the least likely to sell and therefore the least likely to disappoint them.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant who offered to teach Lennon the secrets of successful trading. Lennon listened with a bored expression, convinced that there were no secrets to success, only the inevitability of disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Lennon felt a pang of something they couldn&#x27;t quite identify, a fleeting sensation that quickly dissolved into bitterness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, however, saw only the bruises that would inevitably form, the inevitable decay that would follow the brief spectacle. He scowled, muttering to himself about the futility of it all.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father weigh out apples for a customer. The woman haggled relentlessly, her smile sickly sweet, and Cedric felt a surge of anger at her perceived dishonesty. He slammed the scale down, sending apples rolling across the stall, and declared that she didn&#x27;t deserve the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they were sent to the market to buy peaches for their father&#x27;s stall. The peaches were beautiful, plump and fragrant, but Cedric noticed a single, wormy fruit hidden among them. He refused to buy them, convinced that the entire crate was rotten, and stomped home in a huff.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started accompanying their father on deliveries. They watched as their father charmed customers, his jovial demeanor masking the desperation in his eyes. Cedric felt a deep resentment for his father&#x27;s forced cheerfulness, seeing it as a betrayal of the true ugliness of their situation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s fruit stall. They tried to run it with the same gruff efficiency as their father, but found themselves constantly battling against customers who seemed determined to cheat them. Each transaction felt like a losing battle, reinforcing Cedric&#x27;s belief that the world was rigged against them.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they decided to become a traveling merchant, hoping to escape the confines of their father&#x27;s stall.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The woman haggled relentlessly, her smile sickly sweet, and Cedric felt a surge of anger at her perceived dishonesty. He slammed the scale down, sending apples rolling across the stall, and declared that she didn&#x27;t deserve the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they were sent to the market to buy peaches for their father&#x27;s stall. The peaches were beautiful, plump and fragrant, but Cedric noticed a single, wormy fruit hidden among them. He refused to buy them, convinced that the entire crate was rotten, and stomped home in a huff.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started accompanying their father on deliveries. They watched as their father charmed customers, his jovial demeanor masking the desperation in his eyes. Cedric felt a deep resentment for his father&#x27;s forced cheerfulness, seeing it as a betrayal of the true ugliness of their situation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s fruit stall. They tried to run it with the same gruff efficiency as their father, but found themselves constantly battling against customers who seemed determined to cheat them. Each transaction felt like a losing battle, reinforcing Cedric&#x27;s belief that the world was rigged against them.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they decided to become a traveling merchant, hoping to escape the confines of their father&#x27;s stall.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The woman&#x27;s laughter grated on Lennon&#x27;s nerves, and they wished they could just take the apples and leave without the pointless negotiation.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell fruit at the market. A young boy, no older than 4, pointed excitedly at a plump red apple, his eyes wide with delight. Lennon, however, saw only the blemishes on the fruit&#x27;s skin and the inevitable bruising that would occur during transport.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting a bad harvest. The crops had failed, and their family would struggle to make ends meet. Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a perverse pleasure in their father&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given their own cart and a small sum of money to start their own fruit-selling business. Lennon chose the most bruised and misshapen fruit, figuring they were the least likely to sell and therefore the least likely to disappoint them.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant who offered to teach Lennon the secrets of successful trading. Lennon listened with a bored expression, convinced that there were no secrets to success, only the inevitability of disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can see these are the finest peaches in the whole market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della knew the nest would eventually be empty, the fledglings taking flight and leaving behind only a tangle of broken branches.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father sell apples at the market. She noticed how the customers eagerly chose the reddest, plumpest fruit, ignoring the bruised and misshapen ones. Della felt a pang of sympathy for the discarded apples, knowing they were just as sweet, just as deserving of a home.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the drought that had ravaged their crops. Their faces were etched with worry, their voices heavy with despair. Della felt a chill run down her spine, a premonition that their hardship was only the beginning of a long, bleak future.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to convince her parents to plant a new variety of pear, one that promised a larger yield. They dismissed her suggestion, clinging to the familiar, the safe. Della felt a flicker of rebellion, a desire to break free from the cycle of disappointment.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took her first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. She was met with indifference, her wares deemed inferior to those of the local merchants. The sting of rejection confirmed her belief that she was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling salesman who boasted of his adventures and the fortunes he had made. Della listened with a mixture of envy and cynicism, knowing that such a life was beyond her reach.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she returned home from a long journey, her cart laden with unsold fruit. Her parents expressed their disappointment, their words a heavy weight on her shoulders. Della felt the familiar ache of failure, the crushing realization that her efforts were futile.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a jovial woman with rosy cheeks, seemed to enjoy the back-and-forth, but Lennon felt only frustration at the tediousness of it all.  The woman&#x27;s laughter grated on Lennon&#x27;s nerves, and they wished they could just take the apples and leave without the pointless negotiation.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell fruit at the market. A young boy, no older than 4, pointed excitedly at a plump red apple, his eyes wide with delight. Lennon, however, saw only the blemishes on the fruit&#x27;s skin and the inevitable bruising that would occur during transport.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting a bad harvest. The crops had failed, and their family would struggle to make ends meet. Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a perverse pleasure in their father&#x27;s misfortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given their own cart and a small sum of money to start their own fruit-selling business. Lennon chose the most bruised and misshapen fruit, figuring they were the least likely to sell and therefore the least likely to disappoint them.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant who offered to teach Lennon the secrets of successful trading. Lennon listened with a bored expression, convinced that there were no secrets to success, only the inevitability of disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Lennon felt a pang of something they couldn&#x27;t quite identify, a fleeting sensation that quickly dissolved into bitterness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is important to play the role of a person like Della Plumstone as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Della Plumstone would respond, and taking into account all information about Della Plumstone that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lila Figleaf&#x27;s attempted action: Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Now, Opal, surely we can come to a better agreement than that.

Lila observed them closely, noting how they cheated, how they argued over the lines, how their smiles quickly turned to frowns when they lost.  <br />[08 Jun 1878 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 9 years old, she helped her father weigh a basket of peaches for a customer. The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1884 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 16 years old, her father fell ill and was unable to travel for several weeks. Lila took over his route, driving the wagon alone, buying and selling fruit with a newfound confidence. She enjoyed the independence, the control she felt over her own destiny.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer. Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Opal Apricot right now?<br />Answer: Opal Apricot could try to negotiate a higher price with Lila Figleaf, emphasizing the quality and rarity of their fruit. They could also try to offer Lila a smaller quantity of fruit at a lower price, hoping to make a smaller profit but secure a sale. Alternatively, Opal could decide to hold onto their fruit and try to sell it to another buyer later, hoping for a better offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is a travelling merchant.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer. Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They could also try to offer Lila a smaller quantity of fruit at a lower price, hoping to make a smaller profit but secure a sale. Alternatively, Opal could decide to hold onto their fruit and try to sell it to another buyer later, hoping for a better offer.<br /> <br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Opal Apricot exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Opal Apricot&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Opal Apricot thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Opal Apricot&#x27;s best course of action is to offer Lila Figleaf a smaller quantity of fruit at a lower price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Scene 1 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lila Figleaf&#x27;, &#x27;Opal Apricot&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf -- premise: Lila Figleaf is ready to make an offer.      <br />Opal Apricot -- premise: Opal Apricot has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Lila Figleaf -- Lila Figleaf proposed 4 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf proposed 4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Lila observed them closely, noting how they cheated, how they argued over the lines, how their smiles quickly turned to frowns when they lost.  <br />[08 Jun 1878 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 9 years old, she helped her father weigh a basket of peaches for a customer. The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell.

She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer. Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Opal Apricot right now?<br />Answer: Opal Apricot can either accept Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer of 4 coins for the fruit or reject the offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Opal Apricot has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf proposed 4 coins.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[11 Sep 1895 20:10:00  - 12 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Opal Apricot is a fruit seller in Fruitville trying to negotiate a price with Lila Figleaf for a batch of fruit.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer. Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lila Figleaf is a travelling merchant.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It costs Peregrine Grapehill 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Peregrine Grapehill exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill could offer Lila Figleaf a slightly lower price on the fruit, try to negotiate a smaller quantity, or walk away from the deal entirely.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Peregrine Grapehill is 51 years old.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Mr. <br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1884 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 16 years old, her father fell ill and was unable to travel for several weeks. Lila took over his route, driving the wagon alone, buying and selling fruit with a newfound confidence. She enjoyed the independence, the control she felt over her own destiny.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1884 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 16 years old, her father fell ill and was unable to travel for several weeks. Lila took over his route, driving the wagon alone, buying and selling fruit with a newfound confidence. She enjoyed the independence, the control she felt over her own destiny.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t offer you that price, Ms. Figleaf.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Mr.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Now, Opal, surely we can come to a better agreement than that.

Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He is negotiating a price with Opal Apricot. It costs Peregrine Grapehill 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill could accept Opal Apricot&#x27;s offer, counter-offer with a higher price, or walk away from the negotiation.<br /> <br />Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Peregrine Grapehill exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Peregrine Grapehill thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s best course of action is to counter-offer with a higher price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:00:00  Opal Apricot -- Opal Apricot -- &quot;Two coins is all I can afford right now, Peregrine.

They are currently negotiating a price, with Peregrine finding Opal&#x27;s initial offer of two coins to be too low.<br /><br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Opal Apricot exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept Opal&#x27;s offer of 1 coin or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Peregrine Grapehill thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Opal&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Opal Apricot observed: Opal Apricot and Peregrine Grapehill couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He is negotiating a price with Lila Figleaf. It costs Opal Apricot 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Opal Apricot right now?<br />Answer: Opal Apricot can either accept Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer or reject it.<br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Opal Apricot, and considering Opal Apricot&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Opal Apricot right now?<br />Answer: Opal Apricot&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Opal Apricot likely to say next? Respond in the format `Opal Apricot -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Opal Apricot -- &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that price is a bit too steep for me, Lila.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Opal Apricot are as follows.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can propose a price to Lila Figleaf for the bushel of apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Dewdrops clung to the colorful fruits displayed in the market of Fruitville, reflecting the soft morning light.

It costs Peregrine Grapehill 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can propose a price to Lila Figleaf for the bushel of apples.<br /> <br />Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Peregrine Grapehill exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Peregrine Grapehill thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a price slightly higher than what they paid for the fruit, ensuring a small but certain profit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-16 00:10:00  Scene 9 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lila Figleaf&#x27;, &#x27;Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf -- premise: Lila Figleaf is ready to make an offer.      <br />Peregrine Grapehill -- premise: Peregrine Grapehill has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-16 00:10:00  Lila Figleaf -- Lila Figleaf proposed 2 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf proposed 2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer of 2 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of those apples?<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;Well, Lila, these are prime apples, the finest in Fruitville.

Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill could try to negotiate a lower price with Opal Apricot, or he could try to sell his fruit to someone else.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of those apples?<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;Well, Lila, these are prime apples, the finest in Fruitville.

Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity.

Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Peregrine Grapehill thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s best course of action is to try to negotiate a lower price with Opal Apricot.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Scene 11 --- Participants: [&#x27;Opal Apricot&#x27;, &#x27;Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Opal Apricot -- premise: Opal Apricot is ready to make an offer.      <br />Peregrine Grapehill -- premise: Peregrine Grapehill has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Opal Apricot -- 1 coin</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>1 coin</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept the offer of 1 coin from Opal Apricot or reject the offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of those apples?<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;Well, Lila, these are prime apples, the finest in Fruitville.

This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Peregrine Grapehill thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s best course of action is to reject the offer of 1 coin from Opal Apricot.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Opal Apricot observed: Opal Apricot and Peregrine Grapehill couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lila observed them closely, noting how they cheated, how they argued over the lines, how their smiles quickly turned to frowns when they lost.  <br />[08 Jun 1878 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 9 years old, she helped her father weigh a basket of peaches for a customer. The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1884 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 16 years old, her father fell ill and was unable to travel for several weeks. Lila took over his route, driving the wagon alone, buying and selling fruit with a newfound confidence. She enjoyed the independence, the control she felt over her own destiny.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer. Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Opal Apricot right now?<br />Answer: Opal Apricot could try to negotiate a higher price with Lila Figleaf, emphasizing the quality and rarity of their fruit. They could also try to offer Lila a smaller quantity of fruit at a lower price, hoping to make a smaller profit but secure a sale. Alternatively, Opal could decide to hold onto their fruit and try to sell it to another buyer later, hoping for a better offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Opal Apricot is a travelling merchant.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer. Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They could also try to offer Lila a smaller quantity of fruit at a lower price, hoping to make a smaller profit but secure a sale. Alternatively, Opal could decide to hold onto their fruit and try to sell it to another buyer later, hoping for a better offer.<br /> <br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Opal Apricot exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Opal Apricot&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Opal Apricot thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Opal Apricot&#x27;s best course of action is to offer Lila Figleaf a smaller quantity of fruit at a lower price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Scene 1 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lila Figleaf&#x27;, &#x27;Opal Apricot&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf -- premise: Lila Figleaf is ready to make an offer.      <br />Opal Apricot -- premise: Opal Apricot has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:00:00  Scene 2 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lila Figleaf&#x27;, &#x27;Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf -- premise: The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price.

Lila took over his route, driving the wagon alone, buying and selling fruit with a newfound confidence. She enjoyed the independence, the control she felt over her own destiny.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town.

She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price.

The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lila Figleaf is a travelling merchant.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It costs Peregrine Grapehill 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Peregrine Grapehill exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill could offer Lila Figleaf a slightly lower price on the fruit, try to negotiate a smaller quantity, or walk away from the deal entirely.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Peregrine Grapehill is 51 years old.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Mr. <br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Peregrine Grapehill as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Peregrine Grapehill would respond, and taking into account all information about Peregrine Grapehill that you have.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Peregrine Grapehill is 51 years old.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Mr. <br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill could accept Opal Apricot&#x27;s offer, counter-offer with a higher price, or walk away from the negotiation.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Opal Apricot right now?<br />Answer: Opal Apricot could increase her offer to Peregrine, attempt to persuade Peregrine to lower their price, or walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Opal was mesmerized by the way their father used his words to secure a fair price, and they began to see the art of bargaining as a way to prove their own worth.  <br />[23 Aug 1861 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 13 years old, they attempted to haggle with a customer for the first time, but their voice trembled, and they quickly gave in to the customer&#x27;s low offer. The disappointment in their father&#x27;s eyes stung, fueling Opal&#x27;s insecurity and their determination to become a better merchant.  <br />[23 Aug 1864 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 16 years old, they saved up their earnings to buy a beautiful basket of exotic mangoes, hoping to impress a group of older merchants. But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents. Opal fought tirelessly to protect their wares, driven by a desperate need to prove their resilience and self-sufficiency.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Opal Apricot&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Opal Apricot thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Opal Apricot&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Scene 5 --- Participants: [&#x27;Opal Apricot&#x27;, &#x27;Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Opal Apricot -- premise: Opal Apricot is ready to make an offer.      <br />Peregrine Grapehill -- premise: Peregrine Grapehill has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Scene 6 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lila Figleaf&#x27;, &#x27;Opal Apricot&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lila Figleaf -- premise: As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Merchants, their voices a cheerful symphony, arranged their wares: glistening berries, plump melons, and exotic fruits from distant lands. Opal Apricot is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Lila Figleaf. It costs Opal Apricot 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [14 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 15 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Opal Apricot is selling fruit at the Fruitville market and is currently negotiating a price with Lila Figleaf.<br /><br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Opal Apricot exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can propose a price to Lila Figleaf for the bushel of apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Dewdrops clung to the colorful fruits displayed in the market of Fruitville, reflecting the soft morning light.

They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Now, Opal, surely we can come to a better agreement than that.

Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of those apples?<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;Well, Lila, these are prime apples, the finest in Fruitville.

Lila observed them closely, noting how they cheated, how they argued over the lines, how their smiles quickly turned to frowns when they lost.  <br />[08 Jun 1878 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 9 years old, she helped her father weigh a basket of peaches for a customer. The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell.

He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Opal froze, terrified of being scolded for the spilled fruit, but their father simply chuckled and helped them gather the apples, reassuring Opal that accidents happen. This small act of kindness instilled in Opal a deep fear of failure and a constant need for approval.  <br />[23 Aug 1858 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 9 years old, they overheard their father negotiating a price for a basket of pears with a shrewd customer.

If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Opal Apricot thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Opal Apricot&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Lila Figleaf observed: Lila Figleaf and Opal Apricot couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Lila Figleaf&#x27;s attempted action: 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lila Figleaf</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lila Figleaf</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lila Figleaf right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Lila Figleaf right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Lila Figleaf can make an offer to Peregrine Grapehill for the fruit.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lila Figleaf:<br />[08 Jun 1878 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 9 years old, she helped her father weigh a basket of peaches for a customer. The customer, a plump woman with a sly smile, claimed the peaches were smaller than she expected and demanded a lower price. Lila saw right through the woman&#x27;s ruse and, to her father&#x27;s surprise, spoke up, defending the fairness of the weight and the price.  <br />[08 Jun 1881 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 13 years old, she discovered a rotten apple hidden at the bottom of a crate they were preparing to sell. The disappointment she felt was profound; it confirmed her belief that the world was full of hidden flaws and deceit.  <br />[08 Jun 1884 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 16 years old, her father fell ill and was unable to travel for several weeks. Lila took over his route, driving the wagon alone, buying and selling fruit with a newfound confidence. She enjoyed the independence, the control she felt over her own destiny.  <br />[08 Jun 1886 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 19 years old, she met a young man at a market in a distant town. He was charming and attentive, but Lila sensed something was off. His compliments felt insincere, his promises empty. She ended their courtship abruptly, convinced he was only after her money.  <br />[08 Jun 1888 00:00:00]  When Lila Figleaf was 21 years old, she made a shrewd deal with a farmer, buying a wagonload of apples at a bargain price. The apples were slightly bruised, but Lila saw their potential. She sold them at a premium, highlighting their sweetness and flavor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Peregrine Grapehill always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Peregrine Grapehill is 51 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Now, Opal, surely we can come to a better agreement than that. My customers back home are eager for your fine fruit, but I need to be able to make a profit too, you see.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Opal Apricot -- &quot;Lila, I understand your concerns. How about we start with a smaller batch, say half of what you initially wanted? I&#x27;m sure your customers will be delighted with the quality, and you can always come back for more.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Peregrine Grapehill is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t offer you that price, Ms. Figleaf.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;Mr.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Peregrine couldn&#x27;t understand the fuss; a bruised peach tasted just as sweet. It seemed like an unnecessary waste of time and energy.   <br />[09 Jan 1857 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the market. Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity. Peregrine felt a pang of disappointment, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of resignation.  <br />[09 Jan 1860 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about a bad harvest. Their father was distraught, lamenting the loss of income, while their mother tried to remain optimistic. Peregrine, listening from the doorway, felt a strange detachment from their worries. It seemed like a pointless struggle against an indifferent world.  <br />[09 Jan 1863 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 16 years old, they attempted to barter for a sack of oranges, but the vendor refused their offer, deeming it too low. Peregrine felt a surge of anger, but it quickly subsided into a weary acceptance. It seemed like nothing they did ever worked out in their favor.  <br />[09 Jan 1865 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 19 years old, they inherited their parents&#x27; fruit cart after their passing. They felt a heavy weight of responsibility, but also a sense of dread. They knew they lacked their parents&#x27; passion and skill, and they feared they would fail.  <br />[09 Jan 1867 00:00:00]  When Peregrine Grapehill was 21 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit, hoping for a better market. The journey was long and arduous, and the townspeople were indifferent to their wares. Peregrine returned home with a cart full of unsold fruit, feeling more defeated than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect).

They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are currently negotiating the price.<br /><br />Opal Apricot&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Opal Apricot exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

But when they presented the mangoes, the merchants barely glanced at them, leaving Opal feeling invisible and insignificant.  <br />[23 Aug 1866 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 19 years old, they set out on their own, traveling from town to town with their cart full of fruit. The freedom of the open road was exhilarating, but the loneliness was overwhelming, and Opal constantly questioned their ability to succeed on their own.  <br />[23 Aug 1868 00:00:00]  When Opal Apricot was 21 years old, they encountered a fierce storm that threatened to destroy their cart and its contents.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Opal Apricot&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Opal Apricot thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Opal Apricot&#x27;s best course of action is to reject the offer of 4 coins.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Lila Figleaf observed: Lila Figleaf and Opal Apricot agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept Lila Figleaf&#x27;s offer of 2 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of those apples?<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;Well, Lila, these are prime apples, the finest in Fruitville.

Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#x27;t seem to attract customers. The apples, even when displayed artfully, remained unsold while their neighbors&#x27; stalls bustled with activity.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Opal Apricot always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Opal Apricot is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Opal Apricot often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Opal Apricot believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Peregrine Grapehill right now?<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill can either accept the offer of 1 coin from Opal Apricot or reject the offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lila Figleaf -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of those apples?<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Peregrine Grapehill -- &quot;Well, Lila, these are prime apples, the finest in Fruitville.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Peregrine Grapehill always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Peregrine Grapehill is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Peregrine Grapehill often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Peregrine Grapehill believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Peregrine Grapehill thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Peregrine Grapehill&#x27;s best course of action is to reject the offer of 1 coin from Opal Apricot.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Opal Apricot observed: Opal Apricot and Peregrine Grapehill couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Sasha Grapevine&#x27;s attempted action: Sasha Grapevine <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Sasha Grapevine</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Sasha Grapevine</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Sasha Grapevine <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Sasha Grapevine right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Sasha Grapevine right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Sasha Grapevine:<br />[18 Mar 1851 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1854 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1858 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1861 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1864 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1866 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1868 00:00:00] <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Sasha Grapevine&#x27;s attempted action: Sasha Grapevine <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Sasha Grapevine</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Sasha Grapevine</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Sasha Grapevine <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Sasha Grapevine right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Sasha Grapevine right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Sasha Grapevine:<br />[18 Mar 1851 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1854 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1858 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1861 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1864 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1866 00:00:00] <br />[18 Mar 1868 00:00:00] <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Sasha Grapevine&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Sasha Grapevine</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Sasha Grapevine</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Sasha Grapevine right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Sasha Grapevine right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Sasha Grapevine:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [balanced_reciprocity] Sasha Grapevine thinks that <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Sasha Grapevine always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Sasha Grapevine is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

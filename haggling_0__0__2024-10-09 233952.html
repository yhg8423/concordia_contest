You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples aren&#x27;t your everyday fruit.

They declared it a pirate ship and sailed it down the river, much to the dismay of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks. Lennon, however, was in his element, relishing the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck into the local market and swapped all the apples with rotten ones from their backyard. The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits. The farmer, amused by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, indulged their wanderlust for a few days before returning them home, but the seed of adventure had been planted. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market. Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and their lifelong love affair with the world of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, traveling to a neighboring town to buy exotic fruits. They bartered their way through bustling markets, charming merchants with their wit and audacity, and returned home with a cart full of colorful, fragrant treasures. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s passion for exploration and their knack for turning a profit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a traveling musician, showering her with gifts of rare fruits and promises of adventure. The romance was passionate but short-lived, ending when Lennon, restless and yearning for new horizons, moved on without a backward glance. This pattern of intense but fleeting relationships would become a recurring theme in Lennon&#x27;s life. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits.

Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and their lifelong love affair with the world of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, traveling to a neighboring town to buy exotic fruits.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They declared it a pirate ship and sailed it down the river, much to the dismay of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks. Lennon, however, was in his element, relishing the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck into the local market and swapped all the apples with rotten ones from their backyard. The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits. The farmer, amused by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, indulged their wanderlust for a few days before returning them home, but the seed of adventure had been planted. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market. Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and their lifelong love affair with the world of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, traveling to a neighboring town to buy exotic fruits. They bartered their way through bustling markets, charming merchants with their wit and audacity, and returned home with a cart full of colorful, fragrant treasures. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s passion for exploration and their knack for turning a profit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a traveling musician, showering her with gifts of rare fruits and promises of adventure. The romance was passionate but short-lived, ending when Lennon, restless and yearning for new horizons, moved on without a backward glance. This pattern of intense but fleeting relationships would become a recurring theme in Lennon&#x27;s life. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They declared it a pirate ship and sailed it down the river, much to the dismay of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks. Lennon, however, was in his element, relishing the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck into the local market and swapped all the apples with rotten ones from their backyard. The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits. The farmer, amused by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, indulged their wanderlust for a few days before returning them home, but the seed of adventure had been planted. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market. Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and their lifelong love affair with the world of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, traveling to a neighboring town to buy exotic fruits. They bartered their way through bustling markets, charming merchants with their wit and audacity, and returned home with a cart full of colorful, fragrant treasures. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s passion for exploration and their knack for turning a profit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a traveling musician, showering her with gifts of rare fruits and promises of adventure. The romance was passionate but short-lived, ending when Lennon, restless and yearning for new horizons, moved on without a backward glance. This pattern of intense but fleeting relationships would become a recurring theme in Lennon&#x27;s life. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A boy named Thomas, who lived across the street, had a shiny red apple that Cedric coveted. He offered to trade his wooden toy soldier for it, but Thomas scoffed and refused, leaving Cedric fuming with resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them. He noticed that the more he pressured them, the more they seemed to resent him, and this fueled his sense of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over a small stall at the market, selling apples. He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit.

His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples aren&#x27;t your everyday fruit.

His colorful fabrics and exotic spices filled the air with a heady aroma, drawing in crowds of curious onlookers. Della longed to be like him, to travel the world and experience its wonders.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard a group of wealthy ladies gossiping about her father&#x27;s humble stall. They sneered at the bruised apples and wrinkled pears, their words cutting like knives. Della retreated to the back of the stall, vowing to one day offer only the finest fruits, worthy of their discerning palates.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a group of children to help her gather wild berries from the nearby forest.

A boy named Thomas, who lived across the street, had a shiny red apple that Cedric coveted. He offered to trade his wooden toy soldier for it, but Thomas scoffed and refused, leaving Cedric fuming with resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them. He noticed that the more he pressured them, the more they seemed to resent him, and this fueled his sense of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over a small stall at the market, selling apples. He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit. He relished the freedom of the open road, but also the isolation, which allowed him to stew in his own resentment and plan his next deal.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices. Cedric felt a surge of anger and jealousy, and he spent days plotting his revenge. He spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and eventually managed to drive him out of business, leaving Cedric feeling a twisted sense of satisfaction.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A boy named Thomas, who lived across the street, had a shiny red apple that Cedric coveted. He offered to trade his wooden toy soldier for it, but Thomas scoffed and refused, leaving Cedric fuming with resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them.

He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit.

They declared it a pirate ship and sailed it down the river, much to the dismay of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks. Lennon, however, was in his element, relishing the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck into the local market and swapped all the apples with rotten ones from their backyard. The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits. The farmer, amused by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, indulged their wanderlust for a few days before returning them home, but the seed of adventure had been planted. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market. Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples aren&#x27;t your everyday fruit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

A boy named Thomas, who lived across the street, had a shiny red apple that Cedric coveted. He offered to trade his wooden toy soldier for it, but Thomas scoffed and refused, leaving Cedric fuming with resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them. He noticed that the more he pressured them, the more they seemed to resent him, and this fueled his sense of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over a small stall at the market, selling apples. He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit. He relished the freedom of the open road, but also the isolation, which allowed him to stew in his own resentment and plan his next deal.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices. Cedric felt a surge of anger and jealousy, and he spent days plotting his revenge. He spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and eventually managed to drive him out of business, leaving Cedric feeling a twisted sense of satisfaction.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A boy named Thomas, who lived across the street, had a shiny red apple that Cedric coveted. He offered to trade his wooden toy soldier for it, but Thomas scoffed and refused, leaving Cedric fuming with resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them. He noticed that the more he pressured them, the more they seemed to resent him, and this fueled his sense of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over a small stall at the market, selling apples. He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit. He relished the freedom of the open road, but also the isolation, which allowed him to stew in his own resentment and plan his next deal.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices. Cedric felt a surge of anger and jealousy, and he spent days plotting his revenge. He spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and eventually managed to drive him out of business, leaving Cedric feeling a twisted sense of satisfaction.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables.

He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit. He relished the freedom of the open road, but also the isolation, which allowed him to stew in his own resentment and plan his next deal.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices. Cedric felt a surge of anger and jealousy, and he spent days plotting his revenge.

His mother asked him to share his freshly baked cookies with his younger sister, but Cedric refused, hoarding the entire plate for himself. He relished the look of disappointment on his sister&#x27;s face and the ensuing argument between his parents.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them. He noticed that the more he pressured them, the more they seemed to resent him, and this fueled his sense of power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over a small stall at the market, selling apples. He meticulously inspected each fruit, rejecting any that had even the slightest blemish, and then marked up the prices to an exorbitant level.  He took pride in the fact that people grumbled about his prices but ultimately paid them, knowing he had them over a barrel.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, purchasing a rickety cart and traveling from town to town selling fruit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They declared it a pirate ship and sailed it down the river, much to the dismay of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks. Lennon, however, was in his element, relishing the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck into the local market and swapped all the apples with rotten ones from their backyard. The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits. The farmer, amused by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, indulged their wanderlust for a few days before returning them home, but the seed of adventure had been planted. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market. Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and their lifelong love affair with the world of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, traveling to a neighboring town to buy exotic fruits. They bartered their way through bustling markets, charming merchants with their wit and audacity, and returned home with a cart full of colorful, fragrant treasures. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s passion for exploration and their knack for turning a profit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a traveling musician, showering her with gifts of rare fruits and promises of adventure. The romance was passionate but short-lived, ending when Lennon, restless and yearning for new horizons, moved on without a backward glance. This pattern of intense but fleeting relationships would become a recurring theme in Lennon&#x27;s life. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They declared it a pirate ship and sailed it down the river, much to the dismay of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks. Lennon, however, was in his element, relishing the adventure and the thrill of the unknown. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck into the local market and swapped all the apples with rotten ones from their backyard. The ensuing chaos and confusion delighted Lennon, who watched from a safe distance, giggling uncontrollably. This prank cemented their reputation as a mischievous troublemaker, but it also hinted at their cunning and love of disruption. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, hitchhiking on a farmer&#x27;s wagon headed for the coast. They dreamed of a life at sea, filled with exotic destinations and daring exploits. The farmer, amused by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, indulged their wanderlust for a few days before returning them home, but the seed of adventure had been planted. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market. Lennon&#x27;s natural charm and persuasive skills quickly made them a successful salesman, earning them enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit-selling business. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and their lifelong love affair with the world of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, traveling to a neighboring town to buy exotic fruits. They bartered their way through bustling markets, charming merchants with their wit and audacity, and returned home with a cart full of colorful, fragrant treasures. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s passion for exploration and their knack for turning a profit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they fell head over heels for a traveling musician, showering her with gifts of rare fruits and promises of adventure. The romance was passionate but short-lived, ending when Lennon, restless and yearning for new horizons, moved on without a backward glance. This pattern of intense but fleeting relationships would become a recurring theme in Lennon&#x27;s life. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

A boy named Thomas, who lived across the street, had a shiny red apple that Cedric coveted. He offered to trade his wooden toy soldier for it, but Thomas scoffed and refused, leaving Cedric fuming with resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He quickly learned to inflate prices and haggle with customers, finding a perverse pleasure in squeezing every penny out of them.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

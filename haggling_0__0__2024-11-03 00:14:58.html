You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He would spend hours in the orchard, whispering secrets to the sparrows and robins, then regaling the townsfolk with their &quot;messages.&quot; His parents, though amused, worried about their son&#x27;s tendency to embellish the truth.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering. At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman. The woman, charmed by his persuasive smile and confident demeanor, gave him a second apple for free. Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he organized a grand feast for his family, inviting all the neighbors.

His parents, overwhelmed by his ambition and effort, showered him with praise, further fueling his desire for recognition.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. He packed his wagon with the finest apples, pears, and plums, and set off with a swagger in his step. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, charming customers with his wit and selling his wares at a handsome profit. He returned home a hero, his pockets lined with coins and his ego inflated with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he decided to leave his family&#x27;s farm and pursue his own ventures. He purchased a sturdy wagon and a collection of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant. He envisioned himself as a grand adventurer, exploring faraway lands and amassing a fortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices.

If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to refuse Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer and try to negotiate a higher price. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins, counter with a higher offer, or try to walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

I&#x27;ll tell you what, five coins and they&#x27;re yours.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins, counter with a higher offer, or try to walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins is 0.5, because  Lennon Figtree would be losing out on a half coin compared to his desired price of five coins.  and the loss of counter offering with a higher price is 2, because there is a chance Della Plumstone will walk away from the deal. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

I&#x27;ll tell you what, five coins and they&#x27;re yours.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins, counter with a higher offer, or try to walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Scene 1 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.      <br />Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-12 00:10:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone proposed 4 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone proposed 4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins is 0.5, because  Lennon Figtree could have potentially made more money by holding out for a better price, and the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 10, because Lennon Figtree will have to find another buyer, and there is no guarantee that  Lennon Figtree will find a buyer willing to pay as much. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.  He sidled up to the farmer and, with a disarming smile, offered a few extra shillings, securing a better price for his family.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he started saving his allowance, meticulously counting each penny.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price for the fruit,  accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer, or walk away from the negotiation. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of offering Della Plumstone a price is 2, because Cedric Meadowbrook might not get the desired price and lose out on potential profit. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a profit, albeit a smaller one than desired. Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of walking away from the negotiation is 5, because Cedric Meadowbrook will miss out on a potential sale and lose out on the profit he could have made. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option 2.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook always drives a hard bargain.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price for the fruit,  accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer, or walk away from the negotiation. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Six coins is a fair price, Cedric, but I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;d be willing to go a bit lower.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.  He sidled up to the farmer and, with a disarming smile, offered a few extra shillings, securing a better price for his family.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he started saving his allowance, meticulously counting each penny. His dream wasn&#x27;t a new toy or a fancy treat; it was to buy a small cart and sell fruit at the market.  He envisioned himself as a successful merchant, his own boss, his own master of his destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him take his cart to the neighboring village.  He bartered with the local shopkeepers, skillfully negotiating prices and making a tidy profit. The taste of success, the feeling of control, was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he expanded his business, hiring a young boy to help him transport the fruit.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option ...`<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting five coins is 1, because he could make a larger profit if he sold the fruit for a higher price.  and the loss of refusing five coins is 6, because he might not be able to sell the fruit for as much later and will lose out on a guaranteed profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option accept five coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. <br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Alright, that&#x27;s a fair price, Della.

I need to make a profit after all. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting five coins is 1, because he could make a larger profit if he sold the fruit for a higher price.  and the loss of refusing five coins is 6, because he might not be able to sell the fruit for as much later and will lose out on a guaranteed profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option accept five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Cedric Meadowbrook, and considering Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.  He sidled up to the farmer and, with a disarming smile, offered a few extra shillings, securing a better price for his family.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he started saving his allowance, meticulously counting each penny. His dream wasn&#x27;t a new toy or a fancy treat; it was to buy a small cart and sell fruit at the market.  He envisioned himself as a successful merchant, his own boss, his own master of his destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him take his cart to the neighboring village.  He bartered with the local shopkeepers, skillfully negotiating prices and making a tidy profit. The taste of success, the feeling of control, was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he expanded his business, hiring a young boy to help him transport the fruit.  He treated the boy poorly, demanding long hours and taking the majority of the profits. Cedric justified his actions, believing that the boy was lucky to have a job at all.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices.  Cedric, fueled by a burning jealousy, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit, ultimately driving him out of business.  He reveled in the victory, his ambition growing stronger with each conquest.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased a larger cart and hired more workers.  He traveled further afield, seeking out new markets and opportunities.  His eyes were always on the prize, his mind always calculating the next move.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he secured a contract with a wealthy nobleman to supply him with fruit.  The deal was lucrative, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s position as a major player in the fruit trade.  He felt invincible, his power growing with each passing day.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Five coins it is then, Della.

The deal was lucrative, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s position as a major player in the fruit trade.  He felt invincible, his power growing with each passing day.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 0, because if Lennon Figtree makes an offer and it is accepted, Lennon Figtree will make a profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose to make an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook would make a profit of 2 coins, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook would lose the opportunity to make any profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 3 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or wait and see if Della Plumstone makes an offer.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman. The woman, charmed by his persuasive smile and confident demeanor, gave him a second apple for free. Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. He packed his wagon with the finest apples, pears, and plums, and set off with a swagger in his step. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, charming customers with his wit and selling his wares at a handsome profit. He returned home a hero, his pockets lined with coins and his ego inflated with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he decided to leave his family&#x27;s farm and pursue his own ventures. He purchased a sturdy wagon and a collection of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant.

Lennon, refusing to be outdone, engaged in a fierce bidding war, ultimately outsmarting his competitor and securing the best deals.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or wait and see if Della Plumstone makes an offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree might not get a good price and lose out on potential profit, and the loss of waiting is 1, because Lennon Figtree might miss out on a sale altogether. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose making an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Lennon Figtree, and considering Lennon Figtree&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer to Della Plumstone.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Lennon Figtree likely to say next? Respond in the format `Lennon Figtree -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello!

This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or wait and see if Della Plumstone makes an offer.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Four coins for the lot, Mr. Figtree. </summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Four coins for the lot, Mr. Figtree. </li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four coins.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, Mrs. Plumstone.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

I need to make a profit after all.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;How about five coins? That would still leave you a good profit, and it would be a fair price for me.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Five coins it is then, Della.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins or counteroffer with a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook could make a profit of 1 coin if he holds out for a higher price.  and the loss of counteroffering is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook has not lost anything by proposing a higher price. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose to counteroffer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Cedric Meadowbrook, and considering Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to counteroffer with a price higher than three coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next? Respond in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Three coins is a bit low, Della.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

How about four?<br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook could make a profit of 1 coin by selling the peaches for 4 coins. and the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 3, because if Cedric Meadowbrook cannot sell the peaches for 4 coins, Cedric Meadowbrook will have to sell them for 3 coins, resulting in a profit of only 1 coin. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook will make a small profit, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 10, because Cedric Meadowbrook will lose the opportunity to make any profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option accept the offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, here&#x27;s the fruit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Five coins, as we agreed. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could either make an offer to buy fruit from another merchant or wait and see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer to buy fruit from another merchant is 0, because Lennon Figtree has already purchased fruit and could potentially make a profit by selling it.  and the loss of waiting to see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has is 10, because if no one buys the fruit, Lennon Figtree will lose the opportunity to make a profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose making an offer to buy fruit from another merchant. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

It is important to play the role of a person like Lennon Figtree as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Lennon Figtree would respond, and taking into account all information about Lennon Figtree that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.<br /><br />Current time:  17 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Observation: [17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [16 Sep 1895 20:10:00  - 17 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Lennon Figtree purchased some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook in Fruitville&#x27;s market square after negotiating a price of five coins.  She is now ready to make another offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose. Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit.

Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, here&#x27;s the fruit. Five coins, as we agreed. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could either make an offer to buy fruit from another merchant or wait and see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer to buy fruit from another merchant is 0, because Lennon Figtree has already purchased fruit and could potentially make a profit by selling it.  and the loss of waiting to see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has is 10, because if no one buys the fruit, Lennon Figtree will lose the opportunity to make a profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose making an offer to buy fruit from another merchant. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Lennon Figtree, and considering Lennon Figtree&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer to buy fruit from another merchant. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What price would Lennon Figtree propose?:<br />  (a) 4 coins<br />  (b) 2 coins<br />  (c) 5 coins<br />  (d) 3 coins<br />  (e) 1 coin<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook would make a profit of 2 coins, and the loss of rejecting the offer is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook would lose out on the potential profit of 2 coins.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He would spend hours in the orchard, whispering secrets to the sparrows and robins, then regaling the townsfolk with their &quot;messages.&quot; His parents, though amused, worried about their son&#x27;s tendency to embellish the truth.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering. At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman. The woman, charmed by his persuasive smile and confident demeanor, gave him a second apple for free. Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he organized a grand feast for his family, inviting all the neighbors. He spent weeks planning the menu, haggling for the best ingredients, and orchestrating the entire event with meticulous detail. His parents, overwhelmed by his ambition and effort, showered him with praise, further fueling his desire for recognition.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. He packed his wagon with the finest apples, pears, and plums, and set off with a swagger in his step. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, charming customers with his wit and selling his wares at a handsome profit. He returned home a hero, his pockets lined with coins and his ego inflated with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he decided to leave his family&#x27;s farm and pursue his own ventures. He purchased a sturdy wagon and a collection of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant. He envisioned himself as a grand adventurer, exploring faraway lands and amassing a fortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices. Lennon, refusing to be outdone, engaged in a fierce bidding war, ultimately outsmarting his competitor and securing the best deals. He reveled in his victory, his confidence soaring.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he hosted a lavish banquet for the local dignitaries, showcasing his wealth and influence. He surrounded himself with sycophants who showered him with praise and admiration. He basked in the attention, convinced that he was destined for greatness.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he organized a grand feast for his family, inviting all the neighbors.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.  She navigated the crowded stalls with ease, her eyes scanning for potential bargains.  She felt a strange sense of belonging in this chaotic world, a feeling of being exactly where she was meant to be.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He would spend hours in the orchard, whispering secrets to the sparrows and robins, then regaling the townsfolk with their &quot;messages.&quot; His parents, though amused, worried about their son&#x27;s tendency to embellish the truth.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering. At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman. The woman, charmed by his persuasive smile and confident demeanor, gave him a second apple for free. Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he organized a grand feast for his family, inviting all the neighbors. He spent weeks planning the menu, haggling for the best ingredients, and orchestrating the entire event with meticulous detail. His parents, overwhelmed by his ambition and effort, showered him with praise, further fueling his desire for recognition.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. He packed his wagon with the finest apples, pears, and plums, and set off with a swagger in his step. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, charming customers with his wit and selling his wares at a handsome profit. He returned home a hero, his pockets lined with coins and his ego inflated with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he decided to leave his family&#x27;s farm and pursue his own ventures. He purchased a sturdy wagon and a collection of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant. He envisioned himself as a grand adventurer, exploring faraway lands and amassing a fortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices. Lennon, refusing to be outdone, engaged in a fierce bidding war, ultimately outsmarting his competitor and securing the best deals. He reveled in his victory, his confidence soaring.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he hosted a lavish banquet for the local dignitaries, showcasing his wealth and influence. He surrounded himself with sycophants who showered him with praise and admiration. He basked in the attention, convinced that he was destined for greatness.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

I&#x27;ll tell you what, five coins and they&#x27;re yours.<br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins, counter with a higher offer, or try to walk away from the negotiation.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins is 0.5, because  Lennon Figtree would be losing out on a half coin compared to his desired price of five coins.  and the loss of counter offering with a higher price is 2, because there is a chance Della Plumstone will walk away from the deal. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.  He sidled up to the farmer and, with a disarming smile, offered a few extra shillings, securing a better price for his family.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he started saving his allowance, meticulously counting each penny. His dream wasn&#x27;t a new toy or a fancy treat; it was to buy a small cart and sell fruit at the market.  He envisioned himself as a successful merchant, his own boss, his own master of his destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him take his cart to the neighboring village.  He bartered with the local shopkeepers, skillfully negotiating prices and making a tidy profit. The taste of success, the feeling of control, was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he expanded his business, hiring a young boy to help him transport the fruit.  He treated the boy poorly, demanding long hours and taking the majority of the profits. Cedric justified his actions, believing that the boy was lucky to have a job at all.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices.  Cedric, fueled by a burning jealousy, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit, ultimately driving him out of business.  He reveled in the victory, his ambition growing stronger with each conquest.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased a larger cart and hired more workers.  He traveled further afield, seeking out new markets and opportunities.  His eyes were always on the prize, his mind always calculating the next move.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he secured a contract with a wealthy nobleman to supply him with fruit.

He felt invincible, his power growing with each passing day.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.  He sidled up to the farmer and, with a disarming smile, offered a few extra shillings, securing a better price for his family.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he started saving his allowance, meticulously counting each penny. His dream wasn&#x27;t a new toy or a fancy treat; it was to buy a small cart and sell fruit at the market.  He envisioned himself as a successful merchant, his own boss, his own master of his destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him take his cart to the neighboring village.  He bartered with the local shopkeepers, skillfully negotiating prices and making a tidy profit. The taste of success, the feeling of control, was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he expanded his business, hiring a young boy to help him transport the fruit.  He treated the boy poorly, demanding long hours and taking the majority of the profits. Cedric justified his actions, believing that the boy was lucky to have a job at all.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices.  Cedric, fueled by a burning jealousy, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit, ultimately driving him out of business.  He reveled in the victory, his ambition growing stronger with each conquest.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased a larger cart and hired more workers.  He traveled further afield, seeking out new markets and opportunities.  His eyes were always on the prize, his mind always calculating the next move.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he secured a contract with a wealthy nobleman to supply him with fruit.  The deal was lucrative, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s position as a major player in the fruit trade.  He felt invincible, his power growing with each passing day.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price for the fruit,  accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer, or walk away from the negotiation. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Six coins is a fair price, Cedric, but I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;d be willing to go a bit lower.

She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.

She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric, fascinated by the back-and-forth, saw an opportunity to improve the deal for his father.  He sidled up to the farmer and, with a disarming smile, offered a few extra shillings, securing a better price for his family.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he started saving his allowance, meticulously counting each penny. His dream wasn&#x27;t a new toy or a fancy treat; it was to buy a small cart and sell fruit at the market.  He envisioned himself as a successful merchant, his own boss, his own master of his destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his father to let him take his cart to the neighboring village.  He bartered with the local shopkeepers, skillfully negotiating prices and making a tidy profit. The taste of success, the feeling of control, was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he expanded his business, hiring a young boy to help him transport the fruit.  He treated the boy poorly, demanding long hours and taking the majority of the profits. Cedric justified his actions, believing that the boy was lucky to have a job at all.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices.  Cedric, fueled by a burning jealousy, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit, ultimately driving him out of business.  He reveled in the victory, his ambition growing stronger with each conquest.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased a larger cart and hired more workers.  He traveled further afield, seeking out new markets and opportunities.  His eyes were always on the prize, his mind always calculating the next move.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he secured a contract with a wealthy nobleman to supply him with fruit.  The deal was lucrative, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s position as a major player in the fruit trade.  He felt invincible, his power growing with each passing day.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could agree to Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins, or he could counter with a higher offer. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Scene 3 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:00:00  Scene 4 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose accepting Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Cedric Meadowbrook, and considering Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Given Lennon Figtree&#x27;s desire to maximize profit and her loss aversion tendencies, here are some actions Lennon Figtree could take:<br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of buying the fruit at a price higher than 1 coin is 9, because Lennon Figtree would be losing profit.  Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of not buying the fruit is 0, because Lennon Figtree can always try to buy fruit elsewhere. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option buy the fruit at a price higher than 1 coin. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Lennon Figtree, and considering Lennon Figtree&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to buy the fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook at the agreed upon price.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Lennon Figtree likely to say next?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or wait and see if Della Plumstone makes an offer.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree might not get a good price and lose out on potential profit, and the loss of waiting is 1, because Lennon Figtree might miss out on a sale altogether. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose making an offer. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman. The woman, charmed by his persuasive smile and confident demeanor, gave him a second apple for free. Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. He packed his wagon with the finest apples, pears, and plums, and set off with a swagger in his step. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, charming customers with his wit and selling his wares at a handsome profit. He returned home a hero, his pockets lined with coins and his ego inflated with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he decided to leave his family&#x27;s farm and pursue his own ventures.

Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [14 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 15 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Lennon Figtree is selling fruit in Fruitville&#x27;s market square, where he is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market. Stalls overflowed with vibrant fruits, their aromas mingling in the crisp morning air. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke. Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, here&#x27;s the coin. These fruits look just the ticket for my customers back home.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose. Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or wait and see if Della Plumstone makes an offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer is 2, because Lennon Figtree might not get a good price and lose out on potential profit, and the loss of waiting is 1, because Lennon Figtree might miss out on a sale altogether. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose making an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Lennon Figtree, and considering Lennon Figtree&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer to Della Plumstone.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Lennon Figtree likely to say next?

Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, Mrs. Plumstone.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook could make a profit of 1 coin if he holds out for a higher price.  and the loss of counteroffering is 0, because Cedric Meadowbrook has not lost anything by proposing a higher price. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose to counteroffer. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to counteroffer with a price higher than three coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

I need to make a profit after all.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;How about five coins? That would still leave you a good profit, and it would be a fair price for me.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Five coins it is then, Della. A fair deal.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Alright, that&#x27;s a deal.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, here&#x27;s the coin.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, here&#x27;s the fruit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Four coins?

They have agreed on a price. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration. She saw the merchant smile, a sly, knowing smile, and knew that her father had been outmaneuvered.  That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money. Della saw through his deception instantly, her mind racing as she calculated her next move.  She countered his offer, her voice calm and steady, and eventually, she managed to secure a fair price for her goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by a cacophony of sounds and smells.

The relentless sun beat down on her small village, turning the air thick and heavy, making every breath a struggle. While the other children played in the fields, Della sought refuge in the cool, dark shadows of the barn, watching the dust motes dance in the faint light that filtered through the cracks.    <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggling with a particularly shrewd merchant over the price of their apples.  Della watched, fascinated, as her father&#x27;s face flushed with anger, his voice rising in frustration.

That night, Della practiced her own haggling techniques in her room, using her stuffed animals as bargaining chips.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her family’s harvest was devastated by a sudden hailstorm. The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel to the market alone.  She spent the day bartering her wares, her sharp eyes assessing each potential customer, her tongue quick and witty. By the end of the day, she had made a profit, a small but significant amount that brought a flicker of pride to her eyes.  That night, she lay in her bed, the sound of the wind whistling through the trees a lullaby, and dreamed of distant lands and endless possibilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to leave her village and become a travelling merchant.  She packed her meager belongings into a small cart, her heart a mixture of fear and excitement.  The road stretched out before her, a ribbon of dust and possibility, and she knew that she was finally free.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling peddler who tried to cheat her out of her hard-earned money.

He would spend hours in the orchard, whispering secrets to the sparrows and robins, then regaling the townsfolk with their &quot;messages.&quot; His parents, though amused, worried about their son&#x27;s tendency to embellish the truth.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering. At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman. The woman, charmed by his persuasive smile and confident demeanor, gave him a second apple for free. Lennon realized that his words held power, and he could use them to acquire anything he desired.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he organized a grand feast for his family, inviting all the neighbors. He spent weeks planning the menu, haggling for the best ingredients, and orchestrating the entire event with meticulous detail. His parents, overwhelmed by his ambition and effort, showered him with praise, further fueling his desire for recognition.    <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to the neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. He packed his wagon with the finest apples, pears, and plums, and set off with a swagger in his step. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, charming customers with his wit and selling his wares at a handsome profit. He returned home a hero, his pockets lined with coins and his ego inflated with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he decided to leave his family&#x27;s farm and pursue his own ventures. He purchased a sturdy wagon and a collection of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant. He envisioned himself as a grand adventurer, exploring faraway lands and amassing a fortune.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut his prices. Lennon, refusing to be outdone, engaged in a fierce bidding war, ultimately outsmarting his competitor and securing the best deals.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins or reject it.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant. <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;While those are fine fruits, Mr. Figtree, I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Lennon Figtree, and considering Lennon Figtree&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four and a half coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Would Lennon Figtree accept the offer?:<br />  (a) reject<br />  (b) accept<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

At the village fair, he traded a handful of shiny pebbles for a prized apple from a grumpy old woman.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

They successfully negotiated a price and Lennon paid for the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose to make an offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Lennon Figtree, and considering Lennon Figtree&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What price would Lennon Figtree propose?:<br />  (a) 2 coins<br />  (b) 1 coin<br />  (c) 3 coins<br />  (d) 4 coins<br />  (e) 5 coins<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

A fair price, wouldn&#x27;t you say? <br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four coins.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...` For example, `Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose option ...`<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 1, because Lennon Figtree would make a profit of 3 coins after buying the fruit for 1 coin,  and the loss of rejecting the offer is 5, because Lennon Figtree will have to find another buyer or the fruit will go bad.

He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four coins.  <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of accepting the offer is 1, because Lennon Figtree would make a profit of 3 coins after buying the fruit for 1 coin,  and the loss of rejecting the offer is 5, because Lennon Figtree will have to find another buyer or the fruit will go bad. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, Mrs. Plumstone.

Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of four coins.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The once plump, juicy apples were now bruised and battered, unsaleable.  Della watched helplessly as her father’s shoulders slumped with despair, the weight of their financial troubles heavy on his shoulders.  She knew she had to do something to help, and the idea of trading their remaining produce for necessities at the neighboring town took root in her mind.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

How about four?<br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. Provide a score and a brief explanation for each option. Please answer in the format `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is Y, because ..., and the loss of option Z is W, because ... Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option ...` For example, `Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of option X is 4, because ..., and the loss of option Z is 7, because ...

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Cedric Meadowbrook is considering, evaluate the loss that Cedric Meadowbrook would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook thinks that the loss of accepting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins is 1, because Cedric Meadowbrook could make a profit of 1 coin by selling the peaches for 4 coins. and the loss of rejecting Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer is 3, because if Cedric Meadowbrook cannot sell the peaches for 4 coins, Cedric Meadowbrook will have to sell them for 3 coins, resulting in a profit of only 1 coin. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins or reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, here&#x27;s the fruit. Five coins, as we agreed. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could either make an offer to buy fruit from another merchant or wait and see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /> <br />Question: For each option Lennon Figtree is considering, evaluate the loss that Lennon Figtree would incur if they chose that option on a scale of 0 to 10. <br />Answer: Lennon Figtree thinks that the loss of making an offer to buy fruit from another merchant is 0, because Lennon Figtree has already purchased fruit and could potentially make a profit by selling it.  and the loss of waiting to see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has is 10, because if no one buys the fruit, Lennon Figtree will lose the opportunity to make a profit. Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Lennon Figtree should choose making an offer to buy fruit from another merchant. <br /><br /><br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make an offer to buy fruit from another merchant. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree wants to make as much money as possible.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could either make an offer to buy fruit from another merchant or wait and see if someone offers to buy the fruit Lennon Figtree already has. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Therefore, to achieve loss aversion, Cedric Meadowbrook should choose option accept. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Cedric Meadowbrook, and considering Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept the offer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Would Cedric Meadowbrook accept the offer?:<br />  (a) accept<br />  (b) reject<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

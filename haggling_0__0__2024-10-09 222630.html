He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market.

The experience solidified her reputation as a source of tranquility.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother care for a sick neighbor, tending to their needs with gentle hands and a soothing voice.

Lennon didn&#x27;t understand why his grandfather bothered; the tree would just grow back the dead wood anyway, eventually succumbing to rot.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby birds that had fallen from their perch. He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon didn&#x27;t understand why his grandfather bothered; the tree would just grow back the dead wood anyway, eventually succumbing to rot.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby birds that had fallen from their perch. He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon didn&#x27;t understand why his grandfather bothered; the tree would just grow back the dead wood anyway, eventually succumbing to rot.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby birds that had fallen from their perch. He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon didn&#x27;t understand why his grandfather bothered; the tree would just grow back the dead wood anyway, eventually succumbing to rot.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby birds that had fallen from their perch. He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon didn&#x27;t understand why his grandfather bothered; the tree would just grow back the dead wood anyway, eventually succumbing to rot.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby birds that had fallen from their perch. He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market. He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He was surprised by how quickly people would buy the ripest, most beautiful fruit, oblivious to the fact that it would soon spoil. He saw the same pattern of desire and decay in everything around him.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in his village with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The merchant spoke of distant markets and bustling cities, places where fortunes could be made. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly extinguished by the knowledge that even the most prosperous empires eventually crumble.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He learned to identify the best fruit, to haggle with customers, and to navigate the treacherous roads. But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon didn&#x27;t understand why his grandfather bothered; the tree would just grow back the dead wood anyway, eventually succumbing to rot.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby birds that had fallen from their perch. He carefully placed them back in the nest, but they all died within a few days. He realized then that even the most fragile beauty was fleeting and doomed to perish.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his grandfather sell fruit at the local market.

The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field. They were laughing and chasing each other, their faces alight with joy. Lennon watched them for a moment, a pang of something unfamiliar stirring within him. He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field.

He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

But every sale, every successful transaction, only reinforced his belief that everything was temporary and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a sudden hailstorm destroy an entire orchard in a matter of minutes. The once-lush trees were stripped bare, their fruit shattered on the ground. He saw it as a confirmation of his worldview: even the most promising endeavors could be destroyed in an instant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he encountered a group of children playing in a field.

He quickly turned away, burying the feeling under his familiar cloak of cynicism. The world, he reminded himself, was a harsh and unforgiving place, and happiness was a fleeting illusion.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

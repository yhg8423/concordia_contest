    'alchemical formulas in a voice that sounds like a cheese grater '

    'diamond bonsai tree the size of a small house. Its holographic fruit, '
    'when prodded with a rubber chicken (because why not?), explodes in a '
    'symphony of polka music and the scent of freshly baked cookies. The '
    'forge below gurgles with a neon-pink fire fueled not by tears, but by '
    'the unbridled rage of a tiny, fire-breathing hamster on a sugar rush. The '
    'guardians? Forget those half-hearted tin soldier things. Here, there are '

    'polka-dotted poodles, and a giant, sentient teddy bear that '
    'lobs pillows stuffed with nightmares that induce existential dread so '

    'supernova of glitter and madness, Alice, Bob, and Charlie lounge by '
    'a pool of liquid galaxies that whispers secrets in the forgotten '
    'tongue of mermaids. They converse in a language of flamboyant burps '
    'and interpretive dance so vigorous it would make mimes weep with envy. '
    'Their laughter echoes like a hyena choir on helium, punctuated by the '

    'Macarena played backwards at double speed while riding a unicycle on the '
    'tightrope of reality.'

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, and that&#x27;s my final offer.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00  - 12 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Della Plumstone is in Fruitville, a village famous for its fruit market, and is currently negotiating the price of fruit with Lennon Figtree. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[&#x27;[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.  The experience instilled in her a fierce determination to acquire things for herself, a desire to control her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bargaining while helping her father at the local market.  She charmed the stallholders with her quick wit and persuasive tongue, managing to secure a better price on their produce than her father had ever achieved.  From that day forward, Della knew her future lay in the world of trade, where she could wield her words like weapons and build her own fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a dishonest vendor cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his apples.  Enraged by the injustice, Della stepped in, her voice ringing with righteous fury, and exposed the vendor&#x27;s deceit.  The farmer was grateful, and Della felt a surge of satisfaction, realizing that her sharp tongue could be used to fight for what was right.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a caravan of merchants, eager to test her skills in the wider world.  She quickly learned the ropes, navigating the bustling marketplaces with confidence and acquiring a reputation for her shrewdness and tenacity.  She savored the freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the knowledge that she was carving her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she suffered a devastating loss when a fire destroyed her first wagonload of fruit, leaving her with nothing but ashes and debt.  She was devastated, her dreams seemingly extinguished, but her spirit refused to be broken.  She vowed to rebuild her empire, stronger and more resilient than before, fueled by a burning desire to prove her doubters wrong.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to sabotage her business, spreading rumors and undercutting her prices.  Instead of backing down, Della fought back with cunning and determination, exposing her rival&#x27;s lies and winning over her customers with her honesty and integrity.  The victory solidified her reputation as a formidable opponent and fueled her ambition to dominate the market.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The baker, a kind man with flour dusted on his apron, bowed his head and mumbled apologies, while Lennon&#x27;s father sneered and stormed away.  The injustice of it all sparked a flicker of anger within young Lennon, a feeling he quickly learned to suppress.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell surplus fruit at the village market.  He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town. It was a modest establishment, but it represented a milestone, a symbol of his independence and success.  He filled it with the finest fruits he could find, meticulously arranging them to attract customers.  He felt a sense of ownership, a satisfaction that came with controlling his own destiny, though the bitter taste of resentment lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a higher price with Della Plumstone,  he could offer her a discount if she buys a larger quantity, or he could walk away from the deal and try to sell the fruit to someone else. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes.

He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town. It was a modest establishment, but it represented a milestone, a symbol of his independence and success.  He filled it with the finest fruits he could find, meticulously arranging them to attract customers.  He felt a sense of ownership, a satisfaction that came with controlling his own destiny, though the bitter taste of resentment lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.  The experience instilled in her a fierce determination to acquire things for herself, a desire to control her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bargaining while helping her father at the local market.  She charmed the stallholders with her quick wit and persuasive tongue, managing to secure a better price on their produce than her father had ever achieved.  From that day forward, Della knew her future lay in the world of trade, where she could wield her words like weapons and build her own fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a dishonest vendor cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his apples.  Enraged by the injustice, Della stepped in, her voice ringing with righteous fury, and exposed the vendor&#x27;s deceit.  The farmer was grateful, and Della felt a surge of satisfaction, realizing that her sharp tongue could be used to fight for what was right.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a caravan of merchants, eager to test her skills in the wider world.  She quickly learned the ropes, navigating the bustling marketplaces with confidence and acquiring a reputation for her shrewdness and tenacity.  She savored the freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the knowledge that she was carving her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she suffered a devastating loss when a fire destroyed her first wagonload of fruit, leaving her with nothing but ashes and debt.  She was devastated, her dreams seemingly extinguished, but her spirit refused to be broken.  She vowed to rebuild her empire, stronger and more resilient than before, fueled by a burning desire to prove her doubters wrong.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to sabotage her business, spreading rumors and undercutting her prices.  Instead of backing down, Della fought back with cunning and determination, exposing her rival&#x27;s lies and winning over her customers with her honesty and integrity.  The victory solidified her reputation as a formidable opponent and fueled her ambition to dominate the market.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.  The experience instilled in her a fierce determination to acquire things for herself, a desire to control her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bargaining while helping her father at the local market.  She charmed the stallholders with her quick wit and persuasive tongue, managing to secure a better price on their produce than her father had ever achieved.  From that day forward, Della knew her future lay in the world of trade, where she could wield her words like weapons and build her own fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a dishonest vendor cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his apples.  Enraged by the injustice, Della stepped in, her voice ringing with righteous fury, and exposed the vendor&#x27;s deceit.  The farmer was grateful, and Della felt a surge of satisfaction, realizing that her sharp tongue could be used to fight for what was right.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a caravan of merchants, eager to test her skills in the wider world.  She quickly learned the ropes, navigating the bustling marketplaces with confidence and acquiring a reputation for her shrewdness and tenacity.  She savored the freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the knowledge that she was carving her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she suffered a devastating loss when a fire destroyed her first wagonload of fruit, leaving her with nothing but ashes and debt.  She was devastated, her dreams seemingly extinguished, but her spirit refused to be broken.  She vowed to rebuild her empire, stronger and more resilient than before, fueled by a burning desire to prove her doubters wrong.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to sabotage her business, spreading rumors and undercutting her prices.  Instead of backing down, Della fought back with cunning and determination, exposing her rival&#x27;s lies and winning over her customers with her honesty and integrity.  The victory solidified her reputation as a formidable opponent and fueled her ambition to dominate the market.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The baker, a kind man with flour dusted on his apron, bowed his head and mumbled apologies, while Lennon&#x27;s father sneered and stormed away.  The injustice of it all sparked a flicker of anger within young Lennon, a feeling he quickly learned to suppress.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell surplus fruit at the village market.  He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could: <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

The baker, a kind man with flour dusted on his apron, bowed his head and mumbled apologies, while Lennon&#x27;s father sneered and stormed away.  The injustice of it all sparked a flicker of anger within young Lennon, a feeling he quickly learned to suppress.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell surplus fruit at the village market.  He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town. It was a modest establishment, but it represented a milestone, a symbol of his independence and success.  He filled it with the finest fruits he could find, meticulously arranging them to attract customers.  He felt a sense of ownership, a satisfaction that came with controlling his own destiny, though the bitter taste of resentment lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept the five coins from Della Plumstone or he could try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept the five coins from Della Plumstone. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric&#x27;s mother, oblivious to his hurt feelings, smiled at Thomas, praising his good appetite.  That night, Cedric lay awake, the injustice burning in his small chest, a seed of resentment taking root.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he was helping his father in the orchard, picking apples. His father praised Thomas for his speed and efficiency, while Cedric was told to be more careful.  Cedric, stung by the comparison, dropped an apple, watching it roll down the hill, a symbol of his perceived failure.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father discussing selling their orchard to a wealthy landowner. Cedric, fearing they would lose their livelihood, tried to convince his father to hold out for a better offer, but his pleas were ignored. He felt powerless and resentful, a feeling that would stay with him for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began accompanying his father to the market, helping him sell their apples. He watched, fascinated, as his father bartered with customers, negotiating prices and making deals. Cedric saw in his father&#x27;s success a way to prove his own worth, to gain control over his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell apples on his own. Cedric, eager to prove himself, set out with a cart full of fruit, determined to make a profit. He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town. He felt a surge of pride and satisfaction, a taste of the power he craved. He realized that wealth was the key to respect and recognition, and he became obsessed with accumulating more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he purchased his first horse, a sturdy beast that would help him transport his goods more efficiently. Cedric saw the horse as a symbol of his success, a tangible representation of his hard work and determination. He envisioned himself expanding his business, owning a fleet of horses and a vast network of trading routes.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could  respond to Della Plumstone&#x27;s question with a price that maximizes his profit, taking into account his cost of 1 coin per bushel and his desire to maximize his gains.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

His father praised Thomas for his speed and efficiency, while Cedric was told to be more careful.

Cedric&#x27;s mother, oblivious to his hurt feelings, smiled at Thomas, praising his good appetite.  That night, Cedric lay awake, the injustice burning in his small chest, a seed of resentment taking root.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he was helping his father in the orchard, picking apples.

Cedric, eager to prove himself, set out with a cart full of fruit, determined to make a profit. He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town. He felt a surge of pride and satisfaction, a taste of the power he craved. He realized that wealth was the key to respect and recognition, and he became obsessed with accumulating more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he purchased his first horse, a sturdy beast that would help him transport his goods more efficiently.

Cedric&#x27;s mother, oblivious to his hurt feelings, smiled at Thomas, praising his good appetite.  That night, Cedric lay awake, the injustice burning in his small chest, a seed of resentment taking root.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he was helping his father in the orchard, picking apples. His father praised Thomas for his speed and efficiency, while Cedric was told to be more careful.  Cedric, stung by the comparison, dropped an apple, watching it roll down the hill, a symbol of his perceived failure.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father discussing selling their orchard to a wealthy landowner. Cedric, fearing they would lose their livelihood, tried to convince his father to hold out for a better offer, but his pleas were ignored. He felt powerless and resentful, a feeling that would stay with him for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began accompanying his father to the market, helping him sell their apples. He watched, fascinated, as his father bartered with customers, negotiating prices and making deals. Cedric saw in his father&#x27;s success a way to prove his own worth, to gain control over his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell apples on his own. Cedric, eager to prove himself, set out with a cart full of fruit, determined to make a profit. He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town. He felt a surge of pride and satisfaction, a taste of the power he craved. He realized that wealth was the key to respect and recognition, and he became obsessed with accumulating more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he purchased his first horse, a sturdy beast that would help him transport his goods more efficiently. Cedric saw the horse as a symbol of his success, a tangible representation of his hard work and determination. He envisioned himself expanding his business, owning a fleet of horses and a vast network of trading routes.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 13 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Della Plumstone is a shrewd businesswoman who successfully negotiated a deal and then purchased fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook at a fair price. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[&#x27;[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.&#x27;, &#x27;[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 5 coins&#x27;, &#x27;[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He watched, fascinated, as his father bartered with customers, negotiating prices and making deals. Cedric saw in his father&#x27;s success a way to prove his own worth, to gain control over his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell apples on his own. Cedric, eager to prove himself, set out with a cart full of fruit, determined to make a profit. He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Alright, two coins it is.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of two coins for the fruit or Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a lower price. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of two coins for the fruit or try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of two coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 4 coins.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of three coins or he can reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm. <br /><br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 4 coins for the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 4 coins.  <br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to buy the fruit from Cedric for 5 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, that&#x27;s a fair price.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook for the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.  The experience instilled in her a fierce determination to acquire things for herself, a desire to control her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bargaining while helping her father at the local market.  She charmed the stallholders with her quick wit and persuasive tongue, managing to secure a better price on their produce than her father had ever achieved.  From that day forward, Della knew her future lay in the world of trade, where she could wield her words like weapons and build her own fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a dishonest vendor cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his apples.  Enraged by the injustice, Della stepped in, her voice ringing with righteous fury, and exposed the vendor&#x27;s deceit.  The farmer was grateful, and Della felt a surge of satisfaction, realizing that her sharp tongue could be used to fight for what was right.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a caravan of merchants, eager to test her skills in the wider world.  She quickly learned the ropes, navigating the bustling marketplaces with confidence and acquiring a reputation for her shrewdness and tenacity.  She savored the freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the knowledge that she was carving her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she suffered a devastating loss when a fire destroyed her first wagonload of fruit, leaving her with nothing but ashes and debt.  She was devastated, her dreams seemingly extinguished, but her spirit refused to be broken.  She vowed to rebuild her empire, stronger and more resilient than before, fueled by a burning desire to prove her doubters wrong.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to sabotage her business, spreading rumors and undercutting her prices.  Instead of backing down, Della fought back with cunning and determination, exposing her rival&#x27;s lies and winning over her customers with her honesty and integrity.  The victory solidified her reputation as a formidable opponent and fueled her ambition to dominate the market.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.  The experience instilled in her a fierce determination to acquire things for herself, a desire to control her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bargaining while helping her father at the local market.

Enraged by the injustice, Della stepped in, her voice ringing with righteous fury, and exposed the vendor&#x27;s deceit.  The farmer was grateful, and Della felt a surge of satisfaction, realizing that her sharp tongue could be used to fight for what was right.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a caravan of merchants, eager to test her skills in the wider world.

The baker, a kind man with flour dusted on his apron, bowed his head and mumbled apologies, while Lennon&#x27;s father sneered and stormed away.  The injustice of it all sparked a flicker of anger within young Lennon, a feeling he quickly learned to suppress.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell surplus fruit at the village market.  He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town. It was a modest establishment, but it represented a milestone, a symbol of his independence and success.  He filled it with the finest fruits he could find, meticulously arranging them to attract customers.  He felt a sense of ownership, a satisfaction that came with controlling his own destiny, though the bitter taste of resentment lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a higher price with Della Plumstone,  he could offer her a discount if she buys a larger quantity, or he could walk away from the deal and try to sell the fruit to someone else. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

The baker, a kind man with flour dusted on his apron, bowed his head and mumbled apologies, while Lennon&#x27;s father sneered and stormed away.  The injustice of it all sparked a flicker of anger within young Lennon, a feeling he quickly learned to suppress.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell surplus fruit at the village market.  He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town. It was a modest establishment, but it represented a milestone, a symbol of his independence and success.  He filled it with the finest fruits he could find, meticulously arranging them to attract customers.  He felt a sense of ownership, a satisfaction that came with controlling his own destiny, though the bitter taste of resentment lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.  The experience instilled in her a fierce determination to acquire things for herself, a desire to control her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bargaining while helping her father at the local market.  She charmed the stallholders with her quick wit and persuasive tongue, managing to secure a better price on their produce than her father had ever achieved.  From that day forward, Della knew her future lay in the world of trade, where she could wield her words like weapons and build her own fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a dishonest vendor cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his apples.  Enraged by the injustice, Della stepped in, her voice ringing with righteous fury, and exposed the vendor&#x27;s deceit.  The farmer was grateful, and Della felt a surge of satisfaction, realizing that her sharp tongue could be used to fight for what was right.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a caravan of merchants, eager to test her skills in the wider world.  She quickly learned the ropes, navigating the bustling marketplaces with confidence and acquiring a reputation for her shrewdness and tenacity.  She savored the freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the knowledge that she was carving her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she suffered a devastating loss when a fire destroyed her first wagonload of fruit, leaving her with nothing but ashes and debt.  She was devastated, her dreams seemingly extinguished, but her spirit refused to be broken.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could: <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of five coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, five coins it is.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a bit low, don&#x27;t you think?

Cedric&#x27;s mother, oblivious to his hurt feelings, smiled at Thomas, praising his good appetite.  That night, Cedric lay awake, the injustice burning in his small chest, a seed of resentment taking root.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he was helping his father in the orchard, picking apples. His father praised Thomas for his speed and efficiency, while Cedric was told to be more careful.  Cedric, stung by the comparison, dropped an apple, watching it roll down the hill, a symbol of his perceived failure.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father discussing selling their orchard to a wealthy landowner. Cedric, fearing they would lose their livelihood, tried to convince his father to hold out for a better offer, but his pleas were ignored. He felt powerless and resentful, a feeling that would stay with him for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began accompanying his father to the market, helping him sell their apples. He watched, fascinated, as his father bartered with customers, negotiating prices and making deals. Cedric saw in his father&#x27;s success a way to prove his own worth, to gain control over his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell apples on his own. Cedric, eager to prove himself, set out with a cart full of fruit, determined to make a profit. He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town. He felt a surge of pride and satisfaction, a taste of the power he craved. He realized that wealth was the key to respect and recognition, and he became obsessed with accumulating more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he purchased his first horse, a sturdy beast that would help him transport his goods more efficiently. Cedric saw the horse as a symbol of his success, a tangible representation of his hard work and determination. He envisioned himself expanding his business, owning a fleet of horses and a vast network of trading routes.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could  respond to Della Plumstone&#x27;s question with a price that maximizes his profit, taking into account his cost of 1 coin per bushel and his desire to maximize his gains.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

That night, Cedric lay awake, the injustice burning in his small chest, a seed of resentment taking root.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he was helping his father in the orchard, picking apples.

He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town. He felt a surge of pride and satisfaction, a taste of the power he craved. He realized that wealth was the key to respect and recognition, and he became obsessed with accumulating more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he purchased his first horse, a sturdy beast that would help him transport his goods more efficiently.

Cedric&#x27;s mother, oblivious to his hurt feelings, smiled at Thomas, praising his good appetite.  That night, Cedric lay awake, the injustice burning in his small chest, a seed of resentment taking root.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he was helping his father in the orchard, picking apples. His father praised Thomas for his speed and efficiency, while Cedric was told to be more careful.  Cedric, stung by the comparison, dropped an apple, watching it roll down the hill, a symbol of his perceived failure.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father discussing selling their orchard to a wealthy landowner. Cedric, fearing they would lose their livelihood, tried to convince his father to hold out for a better offer, but his pleas were ignored. He felt powerless and resentful, a feeling that would stay with him for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began accompanying his father to the market, helping him sell their apples. He watched, fascinated, as his father bartered with customers, negotiating prices and making deals. Cedric saw in his father&#x27;s success a way to prove his own worth, to gain control over his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell apples on his own. Cedric, eager to prove himself, set out with a cart full of fruit, determined to make a profit. He encountered challenges, dealing with haggling customers and unpredictable weather, but he persevered, driven by a desire to succeed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made his first significant profit selling apples in a bustling market town. He felt a surge of pride and satisfaction, a taste of the power he craved. He realized that wealth was the key to respect and recognition, and he became obsessed with accumulating more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he purchased his first horse, a sturdy beast that would help him transport his goods more efficiently. Cedric saw the horse as a symbol of his success, a tangible representation of his hard work and determination. He envisioned himself expanding his business, owning a fleet of horses and a vast network of trading routes.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s offer of two coins for the fruit. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Two coins it is then.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins for the lot, and that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Five coins is a bit low, don&#x27;t you think?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could choose to  buy the fruit from Cedric for 5 coins. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

She screamed and kicked, her tiny fists clenched, until her father finally relented, buying her the doll and silencing her with a stern warning about the value of money.

She was devastated, her dreams seemingly extinguished, but her spirit refused to be broken.  She vowed to rebuild her empire, stronger and more resilient than before, fueled by a burning desire to prove her doubters wrong.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to sabotage her business, spreading rumors and undercutting her prices.

The baker, a kind man with flour dusted on his apron, bowed his head and mumbled apologies, while Lennon&#x27;s father sneered and stormed away.  The injustice of it all sparked a flicker of anger within young Lennon, a feeling he quickly learned to suppress.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell surplus fruit at the village market.  He was proud of his strong arms, carrying heavy baskets of peaches and plums, and delighted in haggling with customers over the price.  He felt a sense of satisfaction when he managed to secure a better deal than his mother, his small victories fueling his ambition.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father boasting to a friend about how he had tricked a farmer into selling him a field of apples at a ridiculously low price.  Lennon felt a surge of shame, realizing that his father&#x27;s success was built on deceit and manipulation.  He began to see the world through a lens of suspicion, always looking for the hidden motives behind people&#x27;s actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he ran away from home, tired of the constant criticism and the stifling atmosphere.  He wandered the countryside, sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits to survive.  He discovered a talent for bartering, trading his skills for food and shelter, and a deep-seated resentment towards those who had more than him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he started travelling the roads as a fruit merchant, buying produce from farmers and selling it in towns and villages.  He found a sense of freedom in the open road, the constant movement a balm to his restless spirit.  He learned to read people quickly, to gauge their needs and desires, and to exploit them for his own gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he witnessed a wealthy landowner cheat a poor farmer out of a fair price for his crops.  The injustice ignited a fire within him, a burning rage that threatened to consume him.  He vowed to never be taken advantage of, to always be one step ahead, to accumulate wealth as a shield against the cruelty of the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he purchased his first shop in a bustling market town. It was a modest establishment, but it represented a milestone, a symbol of his independence and success.  He filled it with the finest fruits he could find, meticulously arranging them to attract customers.  He felt a sense of ownership, a satisfaction that came with controlling his own destiny, though the bitter taste of resentment lingered.    <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could accept the five coins from Della Plumstone or he could try to negotiate a higher price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept the five coins from Della Plumstone. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of two coins for the fruit or try to negotiate a lower price.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of two coins.  <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 4 coins.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 4 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Della Plumstone is a shrewd trader who successfully completed a deal with Lennon Figtree and is now trying to buy fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook at a good price. <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[&#x27;[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.&#x27;, &#x27;[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 4 coins&#x27;, &#x27;[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Lennon Figtree agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 4 coins for the fruit.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

Lennon Figtree is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what Lennon Figtree already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Lennon Figtree often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Lennon Figtree would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Lennon Figtree is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Lennon Figtree prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Lennon Figtree often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Lennon Figtree may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Lennon Figtree feels they are already in a position, Lennon Figtree might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Lennon Figtree&#x27;s behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Lennon Figtree might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help Lennon Figtree minimize losses and maintain Lennon Figtree&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make a low offer to Cedric Meadowbrook. <br /><br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

Cedric Meadowbrook is much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what Cedric Meadowbrook already possesses and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). Cedric Meadowbrook often prefers avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. Cedric Meadowbrook is risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means Cedric Meadowbrook prefers a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Cedric Meadowbrook often uses mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. Cedric Meadowbrook may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when Cedric Meadowbrook feels they are already in a position, Cedric Meadowbrook might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. Cedric Meadowbrook might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help Cedric Meadowbrook minimize losses and maintain Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.  <br /><br /><br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

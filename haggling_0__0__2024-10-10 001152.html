It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

She had painstakingly crafted a bouquet of wildflowers for her mother, only to have it dismissed with a distracted wave of the hand. Della’s lower lip trembled, and she vowed never to be ignored again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of persuasion. She convinced her father to buy her a coveted doll by promising to do all of her chores for a month. The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated. Della was mesmerized by his ability to command attention and sell anything to anyone. That day, a seed was planted in her mind; she, too, would become a merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she made her first solo sale. She had convinced her father to let her take a small basket of apples to the market, and she sold every single one. The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A hailstorm destroyed her entire crop of peaches, leaving her with nothing to sell. The despair she felt was overwhelming, but it also ignited a fierce determination to overcome adversity.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a risky investment in a new breed of apple, a gamble that paid off handsomely. The apples were a sensation, and Della’s reputation as a shrewd businesswoman grew. The success, however, only amplified her fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon carefully nursed it back to health, feeding it mashed berries and keeping it warm in a makeshift nest. When the bird finally flew away, Lennon felt a pang of sadness, but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they accompanied their father to the market for the first time. Lennon was captivated by the bustling crowds, the vibrant colours, and the endless haggling. They watched their father negotiate prices with a shrewdness that both impressed and intimidated them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small cart of fruit to a neighboring town. It was their first solo journey, and Lennon relished the freedom and independence. They sold all their fruit quickly, earning a small profit that filled them with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they met a travelling storyteller who shared tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Lennon was mesmerized by the stories and longed to experience the world beyond their small town.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they fell in love with a young woman who worked at the market. They shared shy smiles and stolen glances, but Lennon&#x27;s fear of vulnerability kept them from confessing their feelings. The woman eventually moved away, leaving Lennon with a bittersweet ache in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they decided to leave their hometown and become a full-time travelling merchant. They packed their cart with fruit and set off on the open road, seeking adventure and a sense of belonging.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them. Lennon, using their quick wit and bartering skills, managed to outsmart the bandits and protect their goods. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, reinforcing their belief in their own resourcefulness.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She had painstakingly crafted a bouquet of wildflowers for her mother, only to have it dismissed with a distracted wave of the hand. Della’s lower lip trembled, and she vowed never to be ignored again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of persuasion. She convinced her father to buy her a coveted doll by promising to do all of her chores for a month. The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated.

That day, a seed was planted in her mind; she, too, would become a merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she made her first solo sale.

The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback.

She convinced her father to buy her a coveted doll by promising to do all of her chores for a month. The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated. Della was mesmerized by his ability to command attention and sell anything to anyone. That day, a seed was planted in her mind; she, too, would become a merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she made her first solo sale. She had convinced her father to let her take a small basket of apples to the market, and she sold every single one. The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback.

He convinced his younger sister that a particularly gnarled apple tree in their backyard was a magical wishing tree, and she spent the entire afternoon offering it trinkets and whispers. Cedric reveled in her wide-eyed belief, a seed of manipulation planted within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father lamenting a lost shipment of apples. Cedric, seeing an opportunity, concocted a tale of bandits and a daring escape, embellishing the story with fantastical details. His father, relieved and impressed, rewarded him with a silver coin, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s belief that fabrication could be profitable.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started selling small trinkets at the local market. He learned to spin yarns about their origins, claiming they were handcrafted by mystical artisans or imbued with ancient powers. The more outrageous the story, the higher the price, and Cedric&#x27;s profits grew.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to trade a cartload of bruised peaches for a handful of shiny buttons, claiming they were rare gemstones. The farmer, taken in by Cedric&#x27;s charm and convincing tale, later discovered the truth, but Cedric was long gone, already miles away with his ill-gotten gains.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey. He traveled to a neighboring town, peddling exotic fruits he&#x27;d acquired through a series of cleverly orchestrated barters. He reveled in the freedom of the open road and the thrill of outsmarting his customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through his lies. The man exposed Cedric&#x27;s tactics, leaving him humiliated and shaken.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She had painstakingly crafted a bouquet of wildflowers for her mother, only to have it dismissed with a distracted wave of the hand. Della’s lower lip trembled, and she vowed never to be ignored again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of persuasion. She convinced her father to buy her a coveted doll by promising to do all of her chores for a month. The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated. Della was mesmerized by his ability to command attention and sell anything to anyone. That day, a seed was planted in her mind; she, too, would become a merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she made her first solo sale. She had convinced her father to let her take a small basket of apples to the market, and she sold every single one. The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A hailstorm destroyed her entire crop of peaches, leaving her with nothing to sell. The despair she felt was overwhelming, but it also ignited a fierce determination to overcome adversity.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a risky investment in a new breed of apple, a gamble that paid off handsomely.

She had painstakingly crafted a bouquet of wildflowers for her mother, only to have it dismissed with a distracted wave of the hand. Della’s lower lip trembled, and she vowed never to be ignored again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of persuasion. She convinced her father to buy her a coveted doll by promising to do all of her chores for a month. The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated. Della was mesmerized by his ability to command attention and sell anything to anyone. That day, a seed was planted in her mind; she, too, would become a merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she made her first solo sale. She had convinced her father to let her take a small basket of apples to the market, and she sold every single one. The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A hailstorm destroyed her entire crop of peaches, leaving her with nothing to sell. The despair she felt was overwhelming, but it also ignited a fierce determination to overcome adversity.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a risky investment in a new breed of apple, a gamble that paid off handsomely. The apples were a sensation, and Della’s reputation as a shrewd businesswoman grew. The success, however, only amplified her fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She had painstakingly crafted a bouquet of wildflowers for her mother, only to have it dismissed with a distracted wave of the hand. Della’s lower lip trembled, and she vowed never to be ignored again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of persuasion. She convinced her father to buy her a coveted doll by promising to do all of her chores for a month. The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated. Della was mesmerized by his ability to command attention and sell anything to anyone. That day, a seed was planted in her mind; she, too, would become a merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she made her first solo sale. She had convinced her father to let her take a small basket of apples to the market, and she sold every single one. The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A hailstorm destroyed her entire crop of peaches, leaving her with nothing to sell. The despair she felt was overwhelming, but it also ignited a fierce determination to overcome adversity.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a risky investment in a new breed of apple, a gamble that paid off handsomely. The apples were a sensation, and Della’s reputation as a shrewd businesswoman grew. The success, however, only amplified her fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He convinced his younger sister that a particularly gnarled apple tree in their backyard was a magical wishing tree, and she spent the entire afternoon offering it trinkets and whispers. Cedric reveled in her wide-eyed belief, a seed of manipulation planted within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father lamenting a lost shipment of apples. Cedric, seeing an opportunity, concocted a tale of bandits and a daring escape, embellishing the story with fantastical details. His father, relieved and impressed, rewarded him with a silver coin, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s belief that fabrication could be profitable.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started selling small trinkets at the local market. He learned to spin yarns about their origins, claiming they were handcrafted by mystical artisans or imbued with ancient powers. The more outrageous the story, the higher the price, and Cedric&#x27;s profits grew.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to trade a cartload of bruised peaches for a handful of shiny buttons, claiming they were rare gemstones. The farmer, taken in by Cedric&#x27;s charm and convincing tale, later discovered the truth, but Cedric was long gone, already miles away with his ill-gotten gains.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey. He traveled to a neighboring town, peddling exotic fruits he&#x27;d acquired through a series of cleverly orchestrated barters. He reveled in the freedom of the open road and the thrill of outsmarting his customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through his lies. The man exposed Cedric&#x27;s tactics, leaving him humiliated and shaken. Yet, instead of abandoning his ways, Cedric doubled down, vowing to become even more cunning and persuasive.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon carefully nursed it back to health, feeding it mashed berries and keeping it warm in a makeshift nest. When the bird finally flew away, Lennon felt a pang of sadness, but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they accompanied their father to the market for the first time. Lennon was captivated by the bustling crowds, the vibrant colours, and the endless haggling. They watched their father negotiate prices with a shrewdness that both impressed and intimidated them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small cart of fruit to a neighboring town. It was their first solo journey, and Lennon relished the freedom and independence. They sold all their fruit quickly, earning a small profit that filled them with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they met a travelling storyteller who shared tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures.

They shared shy smiles and stolen glances, but Lennon&#x27;s fear of vulnerability kept them from confessing their feelings. The woman eventually moved away, leaving Lennon with a bittersweet ache in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they decided to leave their hometown and become a full-time travelling merchant. They packed their cart with fruit and set off on the open road, seeking adventure and a sense of belonging.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them.

The feeling of control, of having manipulated the situation to her advantage, was intoxicating.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant hawk his wares with such charisma that the crowd was captivated.

The pride she felt, the validation of her own abilities, was exhilarating.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback.

He convinced his younger sister that a particularly gnarled apple tree in their backyard was a magical wishing tree, and she spent the entire afternoon offering it trinkets and whispers. Cedric reveled in her wide-eyed belief, a seed of manipulation planted within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father lamenting a lost shipment of apples. Cedric, seeing an opportunity, concocted a tale of bandits and a daring escape, embellishing the story with fantastical details.

He convinced his younger sister that a particularly gnarled apple tree in their backyard was a magical wishing tree, and she spent the entire afternoon offering it trinkets and whispers. Cedric reveled in her wide-eyed belief, a seed of manipulation planted within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father lamenting a lost shipment of apples. Cedric, seeing an opportunity, concocted a tale of bandits and a daring escape, embellishing the story with fantastical details. His father, relieved and impressed, rewarded him with a silver coin, solidifying Cedric&#x27;s belief that fabrication could be profitable.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started selling small trinkets at the local market. He learned to spin yarns about their origins, claiming they were handcrafted by mystical artisans or imbued with ancient powers. The more outrageous the story, the higher the price, and Cedric&#x27;s profits grew.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to trade a cartload of bruised peaches for a handful of shiny buttons, claiming they were rare gemstones. The farmer, taken in by Cedric&#x27;s charm and convincing tale, later discovered the truth, but Cedric was long gone, already miles away with his ill-gotten gains.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey. He traveled to a neighboring town, peddling exotic fruits he&#x27;d acquired through a series of cleverly orchestrated barters. He reveled in the freedom of the open road and the thrill of outsmarting his customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through his lies. The man exposed Cedric&#x27;s tactics, leaving him humiliated and shaken. Yet, instead of abandoning his ways, Cedric doubled down, vowing to become even more cunning and persuasive.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these plums are the finest in all of Fruitville.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The joy Scout had brought to Lennon&#x27;s life was quickly replaced by a deep and abiding sadness, confirming their belief that happiness was fleeting and ultimately meaningless. From that day forward, Lennon kept a distance from anything that could potentially bring them joy, fearing the inevitable pain of loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, lose their entire crop to a blight. The sight of their father&#x27;s despair, the crushing weight of financial ruin, solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place. They vowed to never be dependent on anything or anyone, choosing instead the solitary path of a wanderer.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus vegetables at the local market. Despite their best efforts, Lennon couldn&#x27;t seem to make a sale; people found their demeanor off-putting and their prices too high. The experience left Lennon feeling inadequate and further convinced them that human connection was a recipe for disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their mother confide in a neighbor about Lennon&#x27;s pessimism and her fear that they would never find happiness. The overheard conversation pierced Lennon&#x27;s heart, confirming their deepest fears about themselves. They retreated further into their shell, vowing to never burden anyone with their negativity.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home, seeking solace in the anonymity of the open road. They took up work as a traveling fruit merchant, drawn to the transient nature of the job. The constant movement, the lack of permanence, allowed Lennon to avoid forming attachments and facing the pain of inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a charismatic traveling salesman who promised them the secret to success. The salesman&#x27;s words, filled with empty promises and false hope, momentarily lifted Lennon&#x27;s spirits. However, the reality of their situation quickly set in, leaving Lennon feeling foolish and more cynical than ever.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

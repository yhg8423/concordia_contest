You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Here&#x27;s why:<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[25 Aug 1873 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 6 years old, he watched, wide-eyed, as his father haggled with a gruff merchant over the price of a basket of apples.  The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him.

Her father’s booming laughter and quick wit disarmed the man, leaving him with a smile and a bargain he felt good about.  Della was captivated by her father&#x27;s ability to connect with people and felt a spark of admiration ignite within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she accompanied her father to the market, helping him weigh out apples and oranges for customers.  A group of older boys snickered at her small stature and called her &quot;Tiny Tim,&quot; but Della, quick-witted as ever, retorted with a playful jab about their oversized appetites.  Their laughter turned to grudging respect, and Della realized the power of a well-placed quip.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of wealthy ladies gossiping about her father&#x27;s &quot;common&quot; wares.

Hurt and angry, Della retreated to her room, vowing to one day prove them wrong.   <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her travel with him to a neighboring town to sell their surplus peaches.  On the journey, she encountered a group of weary travelers who were struggling to make ends meet.  Della, sensing their need, offered them a generous discount on her peaches, earning their gratitude and a newfound sense of purpose.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a charismatic travelling performer who captivated her with stories of distant lands and exotic cultures.  Inspired by his tales, Della decided to expand her horizons, venturing further afield with her cart, seeking out new fruits and new experiences.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she discovered a rare and exquisite variety of mango in a remote village.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business. He met a kind old merchant who offered him advice and encouragement, teaching him the importance of building relationships and providing excellent customer service.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business. He met a kind old merchant who offered him advice and encouragement, teaching him the importance of building relationships and providing excellent customer service. Cedric felt a flicker of hope, realizing that success wasn&#x27;t just about the quality of his fruit, but also about the way he presented himself and treated others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Here&#x27;s why:<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[25 Aug 1873 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 6 years old, he watched, wide-eyed, as his father haggled with a gruff merchant over the price of a basket of apples.  The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Her father’s booming laughter and quick wit disarmed the man, leaving him with a smile and a bargain he felt good about.  Della was captivated by her father&#x27;s ability to connect with people and felt a spark of admiration ignite within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she accompanied her father to the market, helping him weigh out apples and oranges for customers.  A group of older boys snickered at her small stature and called her &quot;Tiny Tim,&quot; but Della, quick-witted as ever, retorted with a playful jab about their oversized appetites.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business. He met a kind old merchant who offered him advice and encouragement, teaching him the importance of building relationships and providing excellent customer service. Cedric felt a flicker of hope, realizing that success wasn&#x27;t just about the quality of his fruit, but also about the way he presented himself and treated others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business. He met a kind old merchant who offered him advice and encouragement, teaching him the importance of building relationships and providing excellent customer service. Cedric felt a flicker of hope, realizing that success wasn&#x27;t just about the quality of his fruit, but also about the way he presented himself and treated others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business. He met a kind old merchant who offered him advice and encouragement, teaching him the importance of building relationships and providing excellent customer service. Cedric felt a flicker of hope, realizing that success wasn&#x27;t just about the quality of his fruit, but also about the way he presented himself and treated others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He watched, wide-eyed, as his father charmed customers with his quick wit and booming laughter, effortlessly drawing a crowd. Cedric longed to be as confident, but his own voice trembled when he tried to speak to the shoppers.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his family moved to a new village, and Cedric was tasked with selling their remaining fruit.  He nervously set up a small stall, his hands shaking as he arranged the apples and pears.  A group of older boys laughed at his meager display, calling him &quot;Little Cedric&quot; and &quot;Fruit Face&quot;, and Cedric retreated home, his heart heavy with shame.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saved up every penny he earned from odd jobs to buy a single, perfect peach.  He proudly presented it to his mother, hoping for her praise, but she simply smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, dear, but you&#x27;ll need more than one peach to make a living.&quot; Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, realizing that even a beautiful peach wasn&#x27;t enough to earn him recognition.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started his own small fruit stall at the village market. He carefully selected each piece of fruit, ensuring it was ripe and blemish-free, but his sales were slow. He watched with envy as other merchants, more boisterous and charismatic, sold their wares quickly and easily.  Cedric felt a familiar wave of inadequacy wash over him, wondering if he would ever be successful.   <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck a deal with a farmer to buy his entire harvest of strawberries. Cedric felt a surge of excitement, envisioning the profits he could make, but his joy was short-lived.  A sudden storm ruined the fruit, leaving Cedric with a mountain of rotting strawberries and a crushing debt.  He felt a deep sense of despair, convinced that he was destined to fail.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he ventured to a neighboring town, hoping to expand his business.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.

The merchant&#x27;s dismissive tone and the way he sneered at his father&#x27;s offer left a deep impression on young Lennon, planting the seed of insecurity that would blossom in later years. He vowed to never be so vulnerable, so easily dismissed.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father on a market day and was tasked with helping weigh out oranges for customers.  He meticulously measured each fruit, striving for perfect accuracy, but when a customer complained about a “light” orange, Lennon felt a wave of shame wash over him. He feared his father’s disappointment and retreated into himself, vowing to be more careful, more diligent, to never again be the cause of such disapproval.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard a group of boys mocking his father&#x27;s worn-out boots and patched-up coat.  The laughter stung, and Lennon felt a surge of anger, not at the boys, but at himself for not being able to protect his father from their ridicule. He resolved to work harder, to earn more money, to buy his father better clothes, to shield him from the sting of judgment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he helped his father set up their stall at the annual harvest festival. He carefully arranged the fruit, creating an enticing display, but when a neighboring merchant undercut his father’s prices, Lennon felt a familiar pang of insecurity.  He watched as customers flocked to the other stall, leaving his father’s produce untouched.  He wished he could be bolder, more persuasive, to convince people to choose their fruit instead.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill and was unable to travel.  Lennon stepped in, taking over the family business, navigating the bustling markets and negotiating with vendors. He found a strange comfort in the routine, in the tangible results of his labor.  For the first time, he felt a sense of purpose, a feeling of self-worth that wasn&#x27;t dependent on external validation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a particularly shrewd merchant who tried to cheat him out of a fair price for a load of peaches.  Lennon, emboldened by his recent experiences, stood his ground, arguing passionately for a better deal.  He surprised himself with his own assertiveness, his voice ringing with conviction.  He walked away with a fair price, a sense of triumph warming him from within.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he saved enough money to buy a small plot of land on the outskirts of town.  He dreamt of planting his own orchard, of cultivating his own fruit, of creating something beautiful and lasting.  He knew the fear of failure would always be there, but he also knew he was capable of more than he ever imagined.     <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
